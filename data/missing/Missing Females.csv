Shirley Joann Banning,"May 23, 1975","Broken Bow, Oklahoma",36,Caucasian / White,"5'9""",160 lbs,"Shirley was last seen in Broken Bow, Oklahoma on May 23, 1975. She spoke to her sister on the phone and said was leaving on a trip with her boyfriend, Alex ""Ace"" Banning Sr. Shirley has never been heard from again. Her yellow 1967 Opal Kadet was found abandoned in the parking lot of the Hilton Inn. Inside were some undergarments, two pairs of shoes, and some flowers Shirley had planned to place on graves for Memorial Day.

Alex had a history of abusive behavior towards Shirley and his ex-wife says he abused her also. Shirley allegedly told her sister that if she ever disappeared, Alex had probably murdered her. Authorities have long considered Alex a suspect in Shirley's case, but no charges were filed against him. He died of a heart attack in 1993, while in prison for an unrelated rape. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

Shirley has never been found. An informant told police Alex had killed her because she was going to reveal incriminating information about one of his family members. Her body may have been dumped in a well in Etna, Arkansas, on property owned by Alex's family.","http://charleyproject.org/case/shirley-joann-banning

Amber Renee Barker,"December 8, 1997","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",10,Caucasian / White,"4'11"" - 5'0""
",70 lbs - 80 lbs,"Amber was last seen at approximately 6:00 p.m. on December 18, 1997 in her hometown of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Her mother spoke to her on the phone while she was at a friend's home and told her to come home. She left her friend's residence and was last seen riding her blue ten-speed bicycle in the 3000 block of northwest 45th Street at the time.

Amber was on her way to her home home in the 3100 block of northwest 39th Street. She never arrived and has never been heard from again.

Amber's bicycle was discovered abandoned in Denniston Park in Oklahoma City on December 19, the day following her disappearance. The bike was located near northwest 27th Street and Drexel Boulevard, which is one mile from her home. Amber's sweater, shoes, one sock and a ring were found along Drexel Boulevard and northwest 12th Street on December 20. One of her shoes was a block away from the other one.

Investigators stated that blood, hair and fiber evidence was discovered near Amber's possessions. There were blue fibers and vomit on her sweater, and a speck of blood on her shoe, but the blood spot was so small that authorities could not link it to any specific person. Authorities were able to form a partial DNA profile for an unknown man from the evidence on the sweater.

Daniel John Smith, Amber's sister's common-law husband, was previously convicted of attempted kidnapping in 1995. He admitted that he assaulted a woman in Oklahoma City while he was intoxicated and tried to steal her car keys. The woman says he tried to rape her. Smith pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a five-year deferred prison sentence and four months at a boot camp, where he earned excellent reviews.

The police had been summoned to another of Amber's sisters' homes in November 1997, approximately one month before the child disappeared. Her sister claimed that Smith hit her after she refused to have sexual relations with him. He was given a citation by authorities but was not arrested. Smith was allegedly at Amber's residence when she called her mother to say she was returning home. He left the residence immediately afterwards and headed west, the same direction Amber was coming from.

Smith was questioned about Amber on the day after her disappearance, and authorities wanted to interview him further, but he discovered hanged from a tree in at Ray Trent Park in Del City, Oklahoma at 11:30 p.m. on December 22, 1997, four days after Amber was last seen. His death was ruled a suicide. Smith was not labeled as a suspect at the time; authorities simply said they wanted to question him regarding Amber's case.

Amber's disappearance remains unsolved. She was a fourth-grade student at James Monroe Elementary School at the time of her disappearance. Her loved ones stated she wasn't having any personal problems when she went missing; neither does she have a history as a runaway.

One of Amber's sisters died in 2013, and her mother died in 2014. Foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved in her case.

Carol Ann Batterman,"May 31, 1958","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",19,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",115 lbs,"Carol was last seen waiting for a bus outside the Crown Motel in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at 3:35 p.m. on May 31, 1958. She was going to take a bus the nearby naval air technical training center where her husband worked; they were going to go to Norman, Oklahoma together to look for an apartment. She never got on the bus and has never been heard from again.

Carol staying in the Crown Motel with her husband, 18-year-old Dennis E. Batterman. They grew up in Westchester, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and were high school sweethearts who married just two weeks prior to her disappearance. Carol wrote a letter to her parents the night before she disappeared, saying she was happy in her marriage. She left her luggage, clothing, makeup, jewelry and $100 in cash behind in their motel room, but she may have been carrying up to $35 in cash at the time of her disappearance.

A witness reported seeing a gray pickup truck, possibly a 1953 Ford, stop at the curb near Carol shortly before she disappeared. The witness saw Carol standing beside the open door of the truck, talking to the driver, who was described as a 40-year-old male, about six feet tall with a slender build. He wore khaki clothes and a large Western-type straw hat.

The witness got distracted for a moment and when he looked again, both Carol and the truck were gone. It's unclear whether this truck had anything to do with her disappearance; no one actually saw Carol get into it.

Authorities believe Carol was taken against her will, and Dennis is not considered a suspect in her disappearance. When he was interviewed by a newspaper in 1961, Dennis said he was still hoping Carol might return and they could begin their life together. Her case remains unsolved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/carol-ann-batterman

Lauria Jaylene Bible,"December 30, 1999","Welch, Oklahoma",16,American Indian / Native American (Cherokee Nation) ; Caucasian / White,"5'5""",130 lbs,"Ashley resided in a trailer home outside of Welch, Oklahoma with her parents, Danny Freeman and Kathy Eketa Freeman, in 1999. Her older brother, Shane, experienced behavioral problems in 1998 and early 1999. Photos of Danny, Kathy and Shane are posted with this case summary.

The family was ordered to participate in a counseling program through the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in 1998 after Shane stole his uncle's pickup truck. Shane returned to his previous behavior after a short period of respite. Danny was charged with abusing his son in late August 1998 after a school counselor notified authorities that Shane's buttocks were bleeding and bruised. Danny maintained that the incident was overblown, while prosecutors contended that he used excessive force. Shane told the court that he was no longer fearful of his father during a pre-trial hearing. Several relatives stated that Shane's problems stemmed from attempting to please Danny.

Several of the Freemans' family members stated that Danny had a violent temper. He was charged with beating his father-in-law after the latter trimmed his bushes without consent in 1985. Kathy's parents told reporters that Danny's temper often hurt her and their children. He also reportedly grew marijuana for his own usage near the family's trailer home. Danny was occasionally unemployed as a result of a work-related injury and the family relied on Kathy's income from her job with Doctor's Optical Supply Company Inc. Kathy was described as a dependable and caring person.

Shane broke into the residence of Ashley's best friend, Lauria Bible, in early January 1999. The Bible family filed a complaint with authorities, stating that Shane took some of Lauria's belongings and money. Shane also stole several of the Bibles' firearms.

Oklahoma law enforcement officer David Hayes shot and killed Shane on January 8. Hayes was on duty at the time of the incident. Shane was on a country road in possession of a stolen vehicle at the time he was encountered by Hayes. The car had apparently broken down. Hayes claimed that Shane reached behind his back and pulled a gun, prompting Hayes to fire at him. The incident was investigated and Hayes's actions were found to be justified.

Danny's trial for the child abuse charges began in March 1999, two months after Shane's death. The jury deadlocked and asked the judge if they could order him to attend counseling. Danny was acquitted of all charges after the jurors' request was refused. The Freemans' relatives reported that tensions were extremely high between Danny and law enforcement at the time, as Danny blamed the police for his son's death and had spoken out against them in the media.

The Freemans' trailer did not have running water and was primarily heated by a wood-burning stove in the living room, but it did have phone service and electricity. The family was described as avid hunters and outdoor enthusiasts who enjoyed living in the remote location. There were numerous firearms stockpiled inside the home and Ashley assisted with hunting food. Danny enjoyed walking along Cabin Creek behind their mobile home to search for arrowheads. His relatives stated that he had an extensive collection of the items, which were rumored to be valuable.

Lauria spent the evening of December 30, 1999 at Ashley's home to celebrate the latter's birthday. Lorene Bible, Lauria's mother, said that Kathy took the girls to the Pizza Hut in Vinita, Oklahoma during the evening. Lorene's statement contradicts authorities' belief that Kathy and the girls visited Big Bill's Barbeque in the 300 block of North Wilson Street in Vinita, Oklahoma. The group traveled in Kathy's blue Toyota and picked up feed for the Freemans' livestock, as well as water from Kathy's mother's house.

Ashley's boyfriend, Jeremy Hurst, told investigators that he met the women at a local Wal-Mart after their dinner. He gave Ashley a silver chain with a heart-shaped pendant embedded with her birthstone for her birthday present. Hurst said that he returned to the Freemans' home with the women shortly afterwards. He said that nothing appeared to be amiss and he departed at approximately 9:30 p.m. One of Danny's relatives visited their residence during the evening and claimed that Hurst actually left at 10:30 p.m.

Authorities said that no outgoing telephone calls were made from the family's home during the night. Kathy planned to take Ashley to her driver's test the following morning. She also planned to stop by the county courthouse, as the Freemans were considering filing a civil lawsuit against the sheriff's department as a result of Shane's death. Lauria had a dental appointment scheduled for the following morning and planned to leave the trailer shortly beforehand.

A passing motorist reported a fire in the vicinity of the Freemans' residence at approximately 6:00 a.m. the following morning. Authorities discovered Kathy's remains inside the debris during the afternoon. Investigators initially stated that they were positive no other bodies were inside the home and did not secure the location during the overnight hours.

Danny was considered the prime suspect in his wife's murder; authorities believed that he may have abducted Ashley and Lauria and traveled elsewhere, but all of the Freemans' vehicles were parked near their home. Lauria's car was also nearby and the keys were inside the ignition. Lorene discovered Lauria's purse propped inside the trailer, but there was no other evidence of the girls at the scene.

Jay Bible, Lauria's father, discovered Danny's body in the bedroom of the mobile home during the following morning. The Bibles returned to the trailer in an attempt to gather more evidence as to their daughter's whereabouts. Both Danny and Kathy had died as the result of gunshot wounds. Danny's body was partially covered by debris inside the bedroom, explaining why his remains were overlooked.

The medical examiner determined that Danny's right collarbone had been fractured prior to the entrance of the fatal wound. The coroner determined that Kathy died at approximately 5:00 a.m. Investigators believe that the fire was intentionally set in an attempt to destroy evidence of the crimes. An extensive search for the girls produced no evidence as to their whereabouts.

Lorene told reporters that Ashley had been saving her money to purchase a used vehicle in December 1999. Lorene said that she believed Ashley had accumulated $1200 in her savings account. Hurst said that Ashley actually claimed to have saved between $3000 and $4000 for the car. She was employed part-time at Roscoe's, a convenience store in Welch. Hurst said that Ashley did not have a bank account; she kept her money sealed in a Tupperware container in the family's freezer. Authorities were unable to locate any evidence of the cash after the fire.

Lorene stated that Ashley and Danny had been arguing earlier in the month regarding the vehicle. She claimed that Ashley wanted to purchase a different car than Danny had desired. There was speculation that Ashley and Lauria were involved in the Freemans' murders after the searches failed to produce evidence as to their whereabouts. Investigators stated that there was nothing in either girl's background to suggest they could be capable of such brutal acts. Authorities disclosed that there were rumors Ashley had been sexually abused, but they were unable to confirm the theories.

Ashley was a member of the National Honor Society and Lauria was regarded as an excellent student. She was also a member of the Welch High School basketball team, although she was unable to participate in the 1999 season as the result of an ankle injury. Lauria was a cheerleader and planned to become a cosmetologist after her high school graduation. Both girls were viewed as well-behaved.

The Freemans' loved ones theorized that local law enforcement may have played a role in the cases. Hayes, the officer who killed Shane, and his brother, also a law enforcement officer, said they both took polygraph exams after the girls' disappearances. Neither of them are considered suspects in the investigations. Hayes and his brother have not participated in the active cases.

Several possible suspects were investigated over the years, including the serial killers Tommy Lynn Sells and Jeremy Brian Jones. In April 2018, eighteen years after the two teens vanished, police announced that they had made a serious break in the case.

Authorities now believe that three men, identified as Warren Phillip ""Phil"" Welch II, David A. Pennington and Ronnie Dean Busick, went to the trailer that night, killed Danny and Kathy, set the fire and took the girls. Pennington and Welch were deceased by the time they were named as suspected, but Busick was been arrested and charged with four counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping and one count of arson.

Photos of Busick, Pennington and Welch are posted with this case summary. Welch, described as ""evil"" and said by witnesses to be the ""mastermind"" in the killings of Ashley, Lauria and Ashley's parents, died in 2007. Pennington died in 2015. All three men had criminal histories, and both Welch and Pennington had documented histories of violence against women.

Am auto insurance verification card which a search party found near the crime scene a few days after the murders, arson and kidnappings. The card belonged Welch's then-girlfriend, who said she did not know the Freeman family, had never been to their home, and had no idea why the card was there, though she admitted Welch knew Danny. Up until a few months before Danny and Kathy were killed, Welch was their nearest neighbor, living in a house less than a mile to the south of the Freemans' trailer.

The insurance card was not given much significance by the police at the time; in fact, they refused to accept it into evidence, and a private investigator kept it instead. The same private investigator found the blue Mercury Topaz linked to the insurance card; it had been sent to a salvage yard. He told the police about it, but the police wouldn't take the car into evidence either. In fact, they called for revoking the private investigator's state license from the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training for Òinterfering in their investigation"" into the case. The insurance card later turned out to be an important clue in the case.

Welch was a ""cooker"" of methamphetamine, and Pennington, his friend, was also involved with meth. After Ashley and Lauria disappeared, Welch broke up with his girlfriend whose insurance card began found near the Freemans' home, but he kept her Mercury Topaz later sold it for salvage. He began dating another woman and she moved in with him in the spring of 2000. This girlfriend told police that Welch had Ashley and Lauria's missing persons poster nailed to the wall of his Pilcher, Oklahoma residence, and while they were living together, she overheard Welch talking with Pennington and Busick about the case.

The three men implied that they had murdered the Freeman parents over a drug debt, taken Ashley and Lauria with them, and eventually killed the girls as well. Welch had several Polaroid photos of the two girls and his girlfriend had seen them. The photos showed Ashley and Lauria lying on a bed which the witness recognized as the one in her and Welch's bedroom.

In February 2017, the Craig County Sheriff found some previously unknown notes and documents about the Freeman/Bible case, including notes from the private investigator who had the insurance card. The papers had been left over from a previous sheriff administration and had apparently been misplaced. Acting on the information in the notes, investigators received additional leads linking Welch, Pennington and Busick to the case and started locating and questioning witnesses. One witness, a former girlfriend of Pennington's, and said Pennington had physically abused her and threatened her life. He had bragged to her about killing the Freemans during a ""bad drug deal.""

According to this witness, Pennington told her one of the Freeman parents was buying drugs, when Ashley and Lauria suddenly walked into the room. Pennington told her he and the other men decided to take the girls from the crime scene to ""have some fun"" with them. They were using Welch's girlfriend's Mercury Topaz that night, and Pennington was aware that her ""ID"" had been found lying on the ground.

Multiple other witnesses connected to the three men gave similar stories of the men boasting about their involvement in the case. Some of them had seen the Polaroids of Ashley and Lauria. In some photos they were bound and gagged and lying on a bed, and in others they were duct-taped to chairs. By the time investigators learned about the photos, they had disappeared and may have been destroyed when they were put in the trunk of a car that was hauled off to a salvage yard. But witnesses could describe them.

There were approximately ten to fifteen photos of the girls. The witnesses were able to identify the bed the girls lay on, and a blanket on that bed, as belonging to Welch, and some of the photos showed Welch lying next to the girls. Busick told one witness the girls had been kept alive for days, perhaps as long as two weeks, in a trailer in Picher, where they were raped, tortured, and eventually strangled to death. Busick said Welch had shot Kathy and Danny, and that he and Pennington had stayed behind to set fire to the trailer after Welch took the girls away. Pennington had referred to the girls as ""two little bitches.""

Pennington and Welch had both threatened witnesses, saying Ashley and Lauria were in a ""pit"" and the witnesses might wind up in the same pit. Because of the threats, none of the witnesses came forward, until they were located and interviewed following the discovery of the lost notes in 2017.

After Busick's arrest for the quadruple homicide, he claimed he suffered from memory loss and didn't remember what had happened on the night of the murders and arson, or where Lauria and Ashley were. He has a low-average IQ and sustained brain damage from extensive drug use and from an incident in 1978, when he was shot in the head. A neuropsychologist who examined him stated he had a hard time processing information. Nevertheless, he was found to be legally competent to stand trial.

In July 2020, Busick pleaded guilty to accessory to second-degree murder. He said Ashley and Lauria's bodies had been put in the root cellar of a residence near 6th and Ethel in Picher. However, searches turned up nothing. Busick was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years of probation.

Authorities still hope to recover the girls' bodies. Foul play is suspected in their cases due to the circumstances involved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/lauria-jaylene-bible

He told the police about it, but the police wouldn't take the car into evidence either. In fact, they called for revoking the private investigator's state license from the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training for Òinterfering in their investigation"" into the case. The insurance card later turned out to be an important clue in the case.

Welch was a ""cooker"" of methamphetamine, and Pennington, his friend, was also involved with meth. After Ashley and Lauria disappeared, Welch broke up with his girlfriend whose insurance card began found near the Freemans' home, but he kept her Mercury Topaz later sold it for salvage. He began dating another woman and she moved in with him in the spring of 2000. This girlfriend told police that Welch had Ashley and Lauria's missing persons poster nailed to the wall of his Pilcher, Oklahoma residence, and while they were living together, she overheard Welch talking with Pennington and Busick about the case.

The three men implied that they had murdered the Freeman parents over a drug debt, taken Ashley and Lauria with them, and eventually killed the girls as well. Welch had several Polaroid photos of the two girls and his girlfriend had seen them. The photos showed Ashley and Lauria lying on a bed which the witness recognized as the one in her and Welch's bedroom.

In February 2017, the Craig County Sheriff found some previously unknown notes and documents about the Freeman/Bible case, including notes from the private investigator who had the insurance card. The papers had been left over from a previous sheriff administration and had apparently been misplaced. Acting on the information in the notes, investigators received additional leads linking Welch, Pennington and Busick to the case and started locating and questioning witnesses. One witness, a former girlfriend of Pennington's, and said Pennington had physically abused her and threatened her life. He had bragged to her about killing the Freemans during a ""bad drug deal.""

According to this witness, Pennington told her one of the Freeman parents was buying drugs, when Ashley and Lauria suddenly walked into the room. Pennington told her he and the other men decided to take the girls from the crime scene to ""have some fun"" with them. They were using Welch's girlfriend's Mercury Topaz that night, and Pennington was aware that her ""ID"" had been found lying on the ground.

Multiple other witnesses connected to the three men gave similar stories of the men boasting about their involvement in the case. Some of them had seen the Polaroids of Ashley and Lauria. In some photos they were bound and gagged and lying on a bed, and in others they were duct-taped to chairs. By the time investigators learned about the photos, they had disappeared and may have been destroyed when they were put in the trunk of a car that was hauled off to a salvage yard. But witnesses could describe them.

There were approximately ten to fifteen photos of the girls. The witnesses were able to identify the bed the girls lay on, and a blanket on that bed, as belonging to Welch, and some of the photos showed Welch lying next to the girls. Busick told one witness the girls had been kept alive for days, perhaps as long as two weeks, in a trailer in Picher, where they were raped, tortured, and eventually strangled to death. Busick said Welch had shot Kathy and Danny, and that he and Pennington had stayed behind to set fire to the trailer after Welch took the girls away. Pennington had referred to the girls as ""two little bitches.""

Pennington and Welch had both threatened witnesses, saying Ashley and Lauria were in a ""pit"" and the witnesses might wind up in the same pit. Because of the threats, none of the witnesses came forward, until they were located and interviewed following the discovery of the lost notes in 2017.

After Busick's arrest for the quadruple homicide, he claimed he suffered from memory loss and didn't remember what had happened on the night of the murders and arson, or where Lauria and Ashley were. He has a low-average IQ and sustained brain damage from extensive drug use and from an incident in 1978, when he was shot in the head. A neuropsychologist who examined him stated he had a hard time processing information. Nevertheless, he was found to be legally competent to stand trial.

In July 2020, Busick pleaded guilty to accessory to second-degree murder. He said Ashley and Lauria's bodies had been put in the root cellar of a residence near 6th and Ethel in Picher. However, searches turned up nothing. Busick was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years of probation.

Authorities still hope to recover the girls' bodies. Foul play is suspected in their cases due to the circumstances involved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/ashley-renae-freeman

Michelle Deanne Crawford,"June 8, 1999","Lawton, Oklahoma",21,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",125 lbs,"Crawford was last seen in Lawton, Oklahoma at 11:00 p.m. on June 8, 1999. She lived with her parents in the 2200 block of northwest Lincoln Avenue at the time. She told her family members that she planned to go to the movies with a friend that evening. She has never been heard from again.

Crawford's parents found her gray four-door 1986 Honda Accord parked crookedly in the 1100 block of east Gore Boulevard, between the Best Western Hotel and Montego Bay Apartments, on June 13. Her purse and other belongings were in the backseat of the car, and all the doors were locked except the front driver's side door. There was no sign of her at the scene.

Crawford had only two close friends, according to her parents, and neither of them had plans to go with her to movies the night of her disappearance. Since she went missing her bank account has not been touched.

Crawford was a junior at Cameron University in 1999; she majored in English and made good grades, and had earned a full scholarship for the next semester of school. She was also employed part-time at Gibsons' Department Store in Lawton. Her family describes her as a generous, responsible, hard-working person and it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.

There's a theory that Crawford's remains are buried on privately owned land in the Mountain View, Oklahoma area. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://charleyproject.org/case/michelle-deanne-crawford

She was reportedly using heroin and working as a prostitute at the time

She stopped reporting to her parole officer in 1977 and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Thirteen years later, after no sign of Cupps, the state dropped the charges against her.

After Cupps's mother's death in 2004, her younger sister filed a missing persons report. Investigators are trying to find Cupps, but all public record for her ends in 1977. Her case remains unsolved.

Monique Christine Daniels,"June 2, 1992","Moore, Oklahoma",15,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",125 lbs,"Monique has was last seen by a neighbor on June 2, 1992 in Moore, Oklahoma. The witness told authorities that she was loading clothes into a blue Chevrolet pickup truck driven by an unidentified Caucasian male. She has never been heard from again.

Monique was abused by her biological father, who is now in prison for sex offenses. By 1992, she lived with her mother, Candyce Daniels, stepfather, Charles ""Chuck"" Daniels, her three siblings and her two half-siblings. She was the oldest child in the family. Her stepfather was a sergeant in the Air Force and her mother was also in the military.

She disappeared while her mother and two of her siblings, Angelique and Bryan, were touring with their church choir for a week. When they returned home, Chuck simply said ""She's gone again."" Angelique would later state that the house, which was normally kept very clean, was in a state of disarray. Beer cans and cigarette butts were lying out, and there was an empty pregnancy test box sitting on the bathroom counter.

Monique's parents didn't report her as a missing person because, they said, they believed she had run away from home. She had run away earlier after she became pregnant and her parents forced her to have an abortion, but her best friend convinced her to return home.

In January 1993, Monique's maternal aunt contacted the police to inquire about her case and learned no missing persons report had been filed. She asked Candyce about it, and two days later, Candyce said Monique had called home and spoken to her younger sister, Angelique, and said she was safe.

A week after that, a letter supposedly from Monique, postmarked Dallas, Texas, arrived in the mail. A second letter arrived in September 1993. The letters said Monique had gotten married and given birth to a daughter named Chelsea, and she and her husband and child they were currently in Alaska but frequently traveled for his job.

Nothing further was heard. Monique's aunt asked the police to check the handwriting on the letters and see if it was really hers. The day before Candyce was supposed to bring them to the police for the examination, the letters and some other items were stolen in a reported burglary at the Daniels family home.

Chuck reportedly said the house was ""so much better"" and ""tranquil"" in the aftermath of Monique's disappearance. Angelique stated her mother and stepfather seemed to ""erase"" Monique from the home; for example, they prohibited their children from talking about their missing sister, and had new family portraits taken to replace the displayed ones that had Monique in them.

In January 1994, Angelique ran away from home and took a bus to Michigan to live with her aunt. When she left, Candyce and Chuck reported her missing immediately. After Angelique arrived at her aunt's home, she filed criminal complaints against her mother and stepfather, alleging physical and mental abuse. (Candyce and Chuck later pleaded no contest to the charges.)

Angelique also told the police that Chuck had made her write the letters they said were from Monique, and that he drove her to Texas so they could mail them. The phone call had been a fabrication as well. Angelique said Chuck had convinced her to go along with his plan so they could provide reassurance for Candyce, who, he said, had become suicidal in the wake of her oldest daughter's disappearance.

When the police asked Chuck about Angelique's allegations, he admitted they were all true. Candyce finally filed a missing persons report at this time. Neither of them would agree to take a polygraph test about Monique's case.

According to Monique's sister and her best friend, Candyce and Chuck were very strict and Monique was often in trouble. One of Monique and Angelique's brothers, Andrew, also alleged there was child abuse in the home. He stated that on the day of Monique's disappearance, she and her stepfather had been fighting. Chuck decided to go on a spontaneous fishing trip with his sons, which was a common event in the family, and told them to say goodbye to Monique.

According to Andrew, Chuck only let them say goodbye to her through her cracked bedroom door. When Andrew looked in, he saw Monique sitting cross-legged and unmoving on the floor. She didn't say anything to him. Andrew's younger brother, Charles Daniels Jr., told a different story, saying he hugged Monique goodbye and she told him she was sorry she couldn't join them.

The others left to go fishing in the rain, without their fishing poles, and according to Andrew, Chuck drove for two hours in one direction, stopped at a fast food restaurant, then drove back home. He parked the car in the garage and left it there with the boys inside for approximately an hour while he was inside the house.

Chuck then let the boys inside, told them he was going to look for Monique, and locked them in his bedroom for two days. One of Monique's other brothers recalled this incident and noted that there was an oil barrel in the back of Chuck's truck at the time.

When questioned by the media about Monique's siblings' allegations, Chuck and Candyce denied them and claimed Angelique was mentally unstable and unreliable and that both she and Andrew have substance abuse issues, something Angelique and Andrew have both denied.

Monique's parents, who now live in Florida, have refused to make any further statements. They have not been named as suspects in her case, but police did dig up the yard at their former home to see if Monique was buried there. Her case remains unsolved.

Linda Sue Davis,"January 7, 1976","Claremore, Oklahoma",29,Caucasian / White,"5'6"" - 5'7""",200 lbs,"Davis was last seen in Claremore, Oklahoma on January 7, 1976. She worked at the Orbits lounge and delivered the receipts to her boss on January 6. She told her boss she thought someone had been following her, but she had lost them.

Davis was last seen at 1:30 a.m. on January 7, in the company an unknown Caucasian male at Don's Club. She has never been heard from again.

On January 8, her car was found abandoned in the 400 block of northwest 9th Street northwest in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. A witness reported seeing the man park the car and walk away the day before.

Davis's purse, containing her driver's license, prescription medications, makeup and various bills and receipts, was in the trunk, along with her light-colored corduroy coat. The coat was bloodstained and had about twenty stab marks in it, and there were human bloodstains inside in the car, on the fender, and in the trunk. One of Davis's brown shoes was found in a nearby bush a few days later.

Davis is divorced and left behind young children. She was scheduled to testify in an assault case: Roland Corky Sanders was charged with pointing a deadly weapon at an officer in the summer of 1975, and Davis had allegedly witnessed it. After her disappearance, Sanders pleaded guilty and was given a two-year deferred sentence.

There is speculation that Davis went into witness protection or fell victim to a serial killer, but little evidence is available in her disappearance and no one has faced any charges. One suspect in her case is incarcerated for the murders of two other women. Davis's case remains unsolved.
Davis has a hysterectomy scar on her abdomen. Her foot and/or toe is fractured from when a horse stepped on it.

Crystal Gayle Dittmeyer,"June 13, 1996","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",12,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",113 lbs,"Crystal was last seen at approximately 5:30 p.m. at her family's residence in Pick Wick Apartments in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on June 13, 1996. The apartment complex is located on West Interstate 240. Crystal was seen near the swimming pool, which is on the south side of the complex. Her hair was tied up in a bun at the time. Crystal has never been heard from again.

Crystal's stepfather, Benjamin Harry Crider Jr., was considered a suspect in her disappearance from the onset of the investigation. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary.

Authorities noticed injuries on Benjamin's body on June 14, 1996, the day following Crystal's disappearance. Benjamin appeared to have human bite marks on one of his arms and bruises on one of his shoulders. He claimed he sustained the injuries while replacing the brakes on the car owned by his wife and Crystal's mother, Tammi Jean Crider.

Investigators took photographs of Benjamin's injuries and also examined Tammi's vehicle. Authorities stated that there was nothing in the car's brake system which would have inflicted the type of injuries they observed on Benjamin's body.

Crystal's younger half-brother came forward two weeks after Crystal vanished and told authorities that he wandered into his parents' bedroom on June 13 after overhearing Benjamin and Tammi arguing. The child claimed he saw Crystal lying motionless in the room. Tammi escorted him out of the apartment and took him shopping afterwards.

When they returned, Crystal had disappeared. Tammi denied her son's statements. She has never been charged in connection with her daughter's case.

Benjamin was employed as a registered nurse for the Oklahoma State Health Department at the time Crystal vanished. Authorities believe he carried her body to his department vehicle inside of a garment bag while Tammi and their son were at the store on June 13, then disposed of Crystal's remains.

Benjamin told authorities that he left their residence at approximately 4:30 p.m. on June 13 to return his vehicle to the Health Department. The trip from Pick Wick Apartments to the department takes 15 minutes; Benjamin claimed he returned to the apartment at approximately 6:30 p.m. two hours later.

Authorities maintained that he could not satisfactorily explain his whereabouts during the unaccounted time period. Benjamin's supervisor at the Health Department told investigators that Benjamin attended a seminar on June 13 and handed in a travel voucher with an additional 100 miles added to his authorized driving distance.

Tammi told investigators she noticed Benjamin purchased a new garment bag the day after Crystal disappeared, which supported law enforcement's theory that Benjamin carried Crystal's body in his old garment bag.

DNA evidence was discovered inside Benjamin's Health Department vehicle which was consistent with Crystal's blood type. Blood stains were also located on the carpet, a table leg, a towel, jeans, a brassiere and on a bedspread inside the family's apartment.

An empty bottle of hydrogen peroxide was discovered inside the residence as well. The peroxide could have been used to clean additional blood stains from the home.

Tammi and Crystal's biological father both took polygraph tests after Crystal vanished. Tammi was asked whether she had caused Crystal to disappear, whether she had worked in collusion with someone else to cause Crystal to disappear, or if she could take investigators to where Crystal was. She answered no to all three questions and failed the test; her results showed high levels of deception.

Benjamin agreed to take the test, but recanted later and refused to participate. The Criders' two other children were removed from their home by Oklahoma Department Of Human Services (DHS) shortly after Crystal's disappearance in 1996. Tammi and Benjamin separated afterwards.

Investigation revealed that DHS had received five complaints regarding Crystal's welfare from her infancy in 1984 until 1991, five years prior to her disappearance.

The allegations of abuse detailed in the complaints centered around the caregivers employed by Tammi to watch Crystal. The reports insinuated that Tammi was ""neglectful"" of Crystal by allegedly ignoring the caregivers' problems. The DHS complaints were either dismissed due to lack of evidence or ruled unfounded.

An unidentified witness told DHS that Crystal was allowed to carry cigarette lighters in the early 1990s and that the child may have been responsible for igniting several fires in her neighborhood at the time due to her allegedly unsupervised home atmosphere. DHS could not discover any evidence regarding the claim and the complaint was dismissed.

DHS did begin a new investigation into the Criders' children's welfare following Crystal's 1996 disappearance. Benjamin was charged with Crystal's murder in 1998 and was convicted of the charge later that same year. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Prosecutors believe he came home from work and found Crystal in the master bathroom shower, which was against the rules, and that they argued and he killed her.

In October 2001, Benjamin's conviction in Crystal's death was struck down by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. He was retried in October 2004, and Tammi testified against him. The judge declared a mistrial.

In September 2005, while awaiting his third trial, Benjamin admitted to causing Crystal's death. He said he struck her in anger and she died, and that he did not intend to kill her.

Benjamin pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to ten years in prison, but since he had already been incarcerated for nine years, he was released only a short time after making the plea. Prosecutors stated they were unhappy with the arrangement, but they decided to agree to it because there was not enough evidence to convict Benjamin of murder.

When investigators asked Benjamin where Crystal's body was, he said he didn't know. He died of a heart attack in Kentucky in 2008, at the age of 49.

Crystal's body has never been located. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.

Judith Ann Elwell,"July 6, 1967","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5,Caucasian / White,"3'4""",40 lbs,"Judith was last seen at her home in the 1100 block of north Meta in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma sometime before 9:00 p.m. on July 6, 1967. She has never been heard from again. The day after her disappearance, one of her shoes was found next to an abandoned house half a block from her home. A short length of braided rope was under the shoe.

Authorities believe Judith was abducted and lost her shoe in her struggle with the kidnapper(s). No other trace of her was located in spite of an extensive search. A photo of Judith's shoe is posted with this case summary.

Judith's brother, Mark Elwell, stated he believed his sister's abduction was planned. He said he saw a suspicious vehicle, described as a big black car, near the home three weeks before Judith went missing, and the driver, a man, also followed Mark on his newspaper route.

Mark says he saw the same vehicle at the home on the night Judith went missing. He believes the driver was Judith's abductor and was ""casing"" the house. Mark's theory has not been substantiated.

Almost a month later, on August 3, Brenda Lois White disappeared from St. Patrick Drive in Midwest City, Oklahoma. A photograph of her is posted with this case summary. She was five years old. In November of that year, her remains were found in a shallow grave in a field outside an abandoned house eleven miles from her home.

Brenda's homicide remains unsolved. Her killer may be the same person who abducted Judith. Both girls were the same age and disappeared from the same area within the same timespan. In addition, both girls were from the same family background and lived in similar neighborhoods, they physically resembled one another and they had both been warned against talking to strangers. However, the girls did not know one another and there is no hard evidence that Brenda's killer also kidnapped Judith.

Troy Thiessen, a private detective from Lawton, Oklahoma, believes one man kidnapped both girls and that he knows the identity of the suspect. The name of the suspect has not been publicly released, but some other details are known. He was in his teens in 1967 and lived in Harrah, Oklahoma. As an adult he was in and out of prison for various offenses, including the sexual abuse of his stepchildren for which he served a fifteen-year sentence.

Judith's parents are both deceased; Mark is her only surviving relative. Brenda's police casefile is believed to have been accidentally destroyed in a flood, and Judith's police casefile was also misplaced or destroyed sometime after 1967, but both girls' cases remain open and unsolved.

She has never been heard from again.

One person at the party, Gary Quisenberry, said Ferree had gone out for cigarettes and never returned. Police didn't believe the story, however; other witnesses stated Quisenberry and Ferree got into an argument and Quisenberry threw a television set at her and killed her.

In 1996, Quisenberry was arrested on unrelated charges of check fraud. While in custody, he confessed to Ferree's murder. Quisenberry said he and Ferree were drinking together at his pickup truck near Gracemont, Oklahoma when they got into an argument and Quisenberry struck her on the neck, killing her. There were some reports that she had been dismembered after her death.

He led investigators to an area in rural Caddo County, Oklahoma, outside Gracemont, saying he had buried the body there. By this time, a new road had been built in the vicinity. Police searched for weeks, but found nothing, and Quisenberry was charged with obstruction of justice.

Another witness came forward when police were searching the Caddo County location and said they'd seen Quisenberry's sister, Belinda Sue ""Susie"" Lee, cutting up Ferree's identification cards. Lee allegedly told the witness she had killed Ferree herself and buried her ""right under their noses."" Based on the witness's information, police searched a Chickasha home for the body. They found nothing there, either.

Quisenberry has never been charged in Ferree's case due to lack of evidence. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, which remains unsolved.

Latricia Diane Fipps,"November 20, 2002","Tulsa, Oklahoma",31,Caucasian / White,"5'0""",105 lbs,"Fipps was last seen in Tulsa, Oklahoma on November 20, 2002. She told multiple people that day that her ex-boyfriend, Joseph Gilbert Calvert, would be picking her up from work so she could get their child from day care. An eyewitness saw Fipps leave with Calvert in his Isuzu Rodeo.

He claims he dropped her off safe at her home, but her mother was waiting at home for her and she never arrived, and she never picked up her children from day care. She has not been heard from since and, when interviewed by police, Calvert said he didn't know what had happened to her.

Shanna Rene Ramsey, who is also known as Rene Calvert, was dating Calvert and living with him when Fipps disappeared. Photos of Ramsey and Calvert are posted with this case summary.

In August 2012, police in New Mexico responded to a report of a woman ""acting hysterical"" and found Ramsey, who was drunk, and she told them her husband had killed someone in Tulsa and made her watch. The New Mexican police contacted Tulsa Crime Stoppers with the information, but no action was taken at the time, in part because Ramsey named the victim as ""Latricia Phelps.""

By January 2013, Ramsey had moved to Owasso, Oklahoma. She was interviewed that month by Tulsa police and told them Fipps had been murdered. She said that after Calvert picked Fipps up on the day of her disappearance, they went to Ramsey and Calvert's home, where an altercation ensued. The three of them left the house together and went to a house where Calvert was doing remodeling work, and he gave Fipps a drink which Ramsey believes contained crushed sleeping pills.

The three then went to a motel near Amarillo, Texas, then to some property near Tucumcari, New Mexico, and while they were walking through a field, Calvert started choking Fipps and asked Ramsey to hold her leg as he did it. Afterwards he put Fipps's body in his vehicle and drove for about half an hour on New Mexico Highway 104 before stopping to bury the corpse in an arroyo.

No charges were filed at the time, but police continued to investigate the case over the years. In early 2018, Calvert and Ramsey were arrested in New Mexico. Ramsey was charged with first-degree murder, and Calvert was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, methamphetamine possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of false identification.

Calvert and Ramsey are awaiting trial. Investigators hope to recover Fipps's body. She had adopted a one-year-old boy prior to her disappearance, and she was in the process of adopting her three-year-old foster daughter. Her mother described her as a dedicated mother. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.

She called her sister-in-law at 8:00 a.m. to say she was on her way to pick up her three children. She never arrived and has never been heard from again. She's described as a devoted parent, and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.

Flores left her car behind at Denny's home with her purse, cellular phone and makeup inside it. He was subsequently arrested on drug and weapons charges and received a suspended sentence. He is the father of her youngest child.

About six months before she went missing, Flores asked for an order of protection against Denny. She stated he had threatened to shoot her in the face. A week later, however, she asked for the order to be dismissed.

Jason Canterberry, a childhood friend of Denny, stated Denny told him he had murdered Flores. Denny allegedly stated he and Flores got into an argument and he shot her twice with a rifle, and she died in his arms. Supposedly, another man was present at the time of the shooting and this individual called his brother to help clean up the crime scene.

Canterberry testified about Denny's alleged confession before a grand jury. Denny denied having ever made such a confession and characterized Canterberry as a drug addict. He maintains his innocence in Flores's disappearance.

A photo of Denny is posted with this case summary. He was arrested in Texas in June 2014 and charged with Flores's murder. Authorities believe he shot her to death, as was stated in the alleged confession, with a 9mm rifle.

Denny was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2015 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Although her body has never been found, foul play is suspected in Flores's case due to the circumstances involved.

She was abducted by her non-custodial mother, Teresa L. Kennedy. A felony warrant for child stealing was issued for her on May 8, 1997.

Kennedy and Bethany were seen in Oak Harbor, Washington after the child's abduction; Kennedy has relatives there. They may be traveling in a blue 1984 Chevrolet Cavalier with the Oklahoma license plate numbered SNG029.

Bethany's parents had gotten divorced in 1996 after ten years of marriage, and initially they shared custody of Bethany and her older sister, Catherine. Teresa abducted only Bethany, leaving Catherine with the girls' father.

Their father was granted full custody of both girls after the abduction and tracked Bethany and Kennedy to Washington, but they disappeared again before he could recover his daughter. Bethany now has half-siblings whose existence she doesn't know about, who would like to meet her someday.

A photo and an age-progressed image of Kennedy are posted with this case summary. Her date of birth is September 19, 1968, making her 28 years old at the time of Bethany's abduction.

Lisa Stasi,"January 9, 1985","Overland Park, KS",19,White,"5'11""",115 lbs,"Serial murder suspect John Edward Robinson Sr. was the last person seen with Lisa Stasi and her five-month-old daughter, Tiffany Stasi.

Lisa has been missing since 1985. She disappeared in January 1985 after Robinson reportedly helped the single mother move out of an area domestic violence shelter and gave her a job working for him. For a few months after her disappearance, the FBI probed allegations that Stasi had been taken across state lines for purposes of prostitution and information that her daughter Tiffany had been sold.

Stasi's family later received typewritten letters over her signature that said she was leaving Overland Park, Kansas with Tiffany and no longer wanted to be in touch with them. One of Stasi's relatives told a detective at the time that she was suspicious because Stasi could not type and the words did not sound like hers. The last known whereabouts of Stasi was an Olathe motel room where Robinson had arranged for them to stay three days before she was last seen. After she was reported missing, Robinson told authorities that he had found a letter from Stasi stating that she and the baby had gone to Denver.

Robinson is also suspected in the disappearances of Paula Godfrey and Catherine Clampitt.

Clampitt relocated to Kansas to live with her brother's family in January 1987. She previously lived in Wichita Falls, Texas with her son. Clampitt had problems with drugs and alcohol in the early to mid-1980s. Her brother agreed to assist her and Clampitt left her child in her parents' custody in Texas while she located employment.

She located an advertisement for Equi II, a management consulting firm in Overland Park, Kansas, shortly after her arrival. Her brother said that the wording in the ad, which promised extensive traveling and a new wardrobe, appeared strange.

Clampitt was hired by the company's owner, John Edward Robinson Sr., shortly afterwards. Clampitt often stayed at local hotels for several nights due to her position, but her brother became concerned for her welfare when she never returned home after leaving on June 15, 1987. He told authorities that he visited Robinson at the Equi II offices and Robinson said he was aware of his search. Clampitt has never been heard from again.

Clampitt's case was reopened in 2000 after Robinson, who has a lengthy criminal history, was charged with murdering several women in the Kansas area. Five bodies were discovered in barrels in a storage facility rented by Robinson, whose trial began in 2000. He is the main suspect in Clampitt's case.

Robinson is also believed to be involved in the disappearances of Paula Godfrey and Lisa Stasi, both young women who were associated with Robinson in Overland Park in 1984 and 1985 and vanished without a trace. Robinson was convicted of Lisa's murder and the murders of two additional women in Kansas in late October 2002. A jury recommended that he receive the death penalty for the other women's homicides and life in prison for Lisa's murder.

Joan Marie Butler,"June 18, 1989","Overland Park, Kansas",24,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",110 lbs,"Butler was last seen during the early morning hours of June 18, 1989 while she was out with friends in Overland Park, Kansas. She apparently made it home from there, as the clothes she had been wearing that evening were found at her apartment, where she lived alone.

Evidence indicates Butler was surprised at her apartment. A half-eaten slice of toast, a half-smoked cigarette and one contact lens were found at the residence, but Butler was missing and so was her red or maroon Chevrolet Corsica rental car, and approximately $900 from her bank account. Neighbors reported hearing a loud thud in the vicinity at approximately 4:30 a.m. on the day Butler vanished.

Butler's vehicle was found parked at an apartment complex in Lenexa, Kansas on June 25. As authorities were arriving, a man approached the Corsica and opened the trunk. When he realized the police were approaching, he shut the trunk and fled. The last trace of Butler was an ATM security camera picture of her, taken on the night of June 26. She was wearing oversized sunglasses in the picture, but a large bruise could be seen on her forehead. She has never been seen or heard from again.

Richard Grissom Jr.'s fingerprints were inside Butler's car, as was his wallet, checkbook and driver's license. A witness later stated she saw Grissom driving a rental vehicle on June 20. An air pistol pellets and CO2 cartridges were found in the glove compartment of the vehicle, and a drop of Butler's blood was in the trunk. There was dust and gravel stuck to the underside of the Corsica, and scratches on the vehicle similar to those caused by branches and brush.

Grissom was arrested in Texas on July 7, 1989. In 1990, he was convicted of murdering Butler and two other women, Theresa Brown and Christine Rusch, roommates who disappeared from Lenexa on June 26. Grissom, who was also convicted of eight charges related to the murders, was sentenced to four life terms in prison; he will not be eligible for parole until 2095. He is also a suspect in at least two other murders, but he has not been charged in those cases. He is a career criminal who committed his first murder at the age of sixteen.

Butler is a graduate of the University of Kansas. She is described as an ambitious young woman. Despite extensive searches, none of the missing women have ever been found. Dan Mitrione wrote about them in a book entitled Suddenly Gone - The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1342dfks.html

Kathryn Louise Adam,"April 29, 1993","Salina, Kansas",35,White/Caucasian,"5'4""",120 lbs,"Adam was last seen at 4:30 a.m. on April 29, 1993, at the Kwik Shop convenience store in the 1700 block of west Crawford Street in Salina, Kansas. She drove a white full-sized Ford van with ""She has Legg's"" written on the sides in blue lettering. A photo of it is posted with this case summary.

The van turned up abandoned at 5:45 p.m. the day after Adam's disappearance, at Russell's Restaurant in the 600 block of Westport Boulevard. The restaurant was closed for remodeling at the time. The van was spattered with mud on the outside and bloodsoaked on the inside, and it had reportedly been driven 60 miles that couldn't be accounted for.

A large amount of blood and some bullet fragments were also found at a storage unit in west Salina, along with indications that someone had tried to clean up. This was where Adam, a salesperson for the Legg's hosiery company, picked up stock each day. There was no sign of her and she has never been heard from again. Authorities stated there was enough blood to indicate probable fatality.

Authorities speculate someone attacked Adam when she went inside the storage unit. It appeared they interrupted her in the process of loading the merchandise in her van, leaving the door of the unit open. Investigators believe whoever was responsible for Adam's disappearance knew her and her routine.

Adam was separated from her husband at the time of her disappearance and in the process of a divorce. Her teenage daughter reported her missing. Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.","http://charleyproject.org/case/kathryn-louise-adam

Tabitha Diane Brewer,"April 27, 1998","Shawnee, Kansas",16,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",115 lbs,"Tabitha Brewer visited her father and stepmother at their apartment complex in Shawnee, Kansas on April 27, 1998. Her 19-year-old boyfriend, Nicholas Travis, accompanied her during the late evening hours.

The couple was last seen departing the residence with a friend, Brandon B. Howell, at approximately 12:00 a.m. They were going to run an errand together. He told authorities he dropped Tabitha and Travis off at the Circle K convenience store near 75th Street and Interstate 35. They never returned home.

Authorities initially assumed the couple ran away together, but soon discovered foul play was likely involved in their disappearances. Both Travis and Tabitha's charred identification cards and Tabitha's purse, with her jewelry and photos of her family inside, were discovered in a dumpster on the corner of 55th Street and Paseo Boulevard in Kansas City, Missouri approximately three days after they vanished. There were no other signs of Tabitha or Travis at the scene.

Travis's body was discovered in August 1998, buried in a shallow grave in the 5400 block of the Paseo in Kansas City, Missouri. His corpse was only found four doors down from the location where the couple's belongings were located more than one year earlier. He was the victim of a homicide; he had several fractures in the back of his skull. There was no sign of Tabitha at the scene. She has never been heard from again.

Tabitha and Travis had been dating for over a year prior to their disappearances; both lived with Tabitha's mother. They had both dropped out of the alternative high school they attended. Tabitha's mother stated her daughter had wanted to marry Travis and have his children. Tabitha is a good typist and was employed as a secretary at a mortgage company at the time of her disappearance.

Authorities identified Howell as a suspect in Tabitha's disappearance and Travis's murder not long into the investigation. Travis's body was found in the backyard of a home Howell's father had renovated, and blood spatters matching his DNA were located. There was a scuff mark like a shoeprint on the underside of the Howell's car's trunk lid as well.

Investigators initially lacked the evidence to charge Howell. In 2006, eight years after Travis and Tabitha disappeared, Howell was charged with the murders of both of them when witnesses came forward with additional information.

A witness stated that on a night in April 1998, they heard Tabitha's voice from inside Howell's father's home, then a man and a woman screaming, and after that the witness saw Howell with blood on his shirt. Howell had also allegedly spoken to several people of a plan to kidnap Tabitha and Travis and rob and kill them. Tabitha had received a $40,000 car accident settlement shortly before her disappearance, but the money was held in trust and she didn't have access to it.

Howell was tried in March 2009. He was acquitted of both murders, but he was serving a twelve-year prison sentence for a 1999 home invasion robbery at the time of the double murder trial and wasn't paroled for another several years. In November 2014, Howell was charged with a dozen crimes, including five counts of murder. Howell is awaiting trial. Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against him.

Tabitha has never been found, but foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2203dfks.html

Star Gail Hurtie / Boomer,"February 23, 1999","Kansas City, KS",39,White,"5'5""",140 lbs,"Boomer visited Uncle Mike's Bar (now called Nobody's Business) in the 4900 block of Metropolitan Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas, near her own residence, on February 23, 1999. She originally went there with a roommate, Carolyn Marshall. Marshall stated while they were in the bar, a male stranger walked up to Boomer and threw her off the barstool, for no apparent reason and without speaking to her.

Boomer got up and insisted she was all right, and her attacker was forced to leave the establishment. Marshall left after finishing her drink, She asked the bartender to keep an eye on Boomer, whom she planned to pick up later. When Marshall called the bar later that day, she was told Boomer had already left with two men. Boomer was carrying a purse with $80 cash at the time of her disappearance. She has never been heard from again. Marshall reported her missing five days later.

Witnesses at the establishment told authorities that she was involved in an altercation with another patron during the evening. The individual is believed to be a career criminal with a history of violent behavior, particularly towards women. He allegedly knocked her to the ground and beat her, causing her to lose consciousness.

According to the witnesses, Boomer had not left the bar with two men like Marshall was told; in fact, she was dragged out of the bar by two men. She has never been heard from again. Authorities believe she may have been murdered in the bar and her body hidden in another location.

In October 1999, two local men, William Eugene ""Geno"" Spradlin and Robert Franklin ""Butch"" Horn, were charged with second-degree murder in Boomer's case. Both suspects have extensive criminal histories and have served time in prison.

The murder charges were later dismissed because over a dozen witnesses to the alleged crime refused to testify against the defendants. Authorities believe that several people have information related to Boomer's case, but the individuals have not come forward.

Curiously, one of the bar patrons who was a witness in Boomer's case was Shon Pernice. Shon's wife, Renee, disappeared in 2009, and he was later convicted of her murder, although Renee's body has never been located. He isn't considered a suspect in Boomer's case, however; he was only questioned because he was a patron at the bar the night she disappeared.

Investigators have taken a new look at the case in recent years, searching various locations for Boomer's body and ripping up the tiles and baseboards at the bar looking for bloodstains. They are trying to locate a possible witness named Edward. Authorities don't believe Edward was directly involved Boomer's suspected murder, but they think he has information on it. He used to frequent the Turner section of Kansas City, Kansas and possibly lived or worked in the area, but has since moved out of state. He may have been a mechanic.

Boomer resided in the 1700 block of south 49th Street in Kansas City in 1999. She was going through a divorce at the time of her disappearance, and planned to move back in with her parents. She has six siblings. She had dropped out of Turner High School, but was studying for her GED certificate, and dreamed of becoming a florist.

Boomer left behind a young son, who was raised by his grandparents after her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected in Boomer's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.

Maud Robinson Crawford,"March 2, 1957","Camden, Arkansas",63,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",165 lbs,"Maud was the first female attorney in Camden, Arkansas. She ""read for the law"", meaning she studied law without attending law school, then took the bar exam with University of Arkansas School of Law graduates and passed with the highest score in the class. She was regarded as one of the top title and abstract attorneys in Ouachita County, and she was also was very skilled in estate management.

United States Senator John McClellan was a partner in the law firm where Maud was employed. A photograph of McClellan is posted with this case summary.

Maud was last seen at her residence on northwest Clifton Street during the evening hours of March 2, 1957. Her husband, Clyde, a cabinetmaker, went to a local movie theater and a liquor store during the night. Maud was sitting on her couch shelling beans when Clyde left their home. At 8:30 p.m., her cousin called and spoke to Maud briefly. This is the last time anyone has heard from her.

Clyde returned home several hours later, at approximately 11:30 p.m. and saw that the lights were on inside the residence and on both porches. Their television set was turned on and Maud's pan of beans sat on a table. Her purse was inside the home and over $100 was inside her wallet.

None of Maud's clothing was missing. Several legal files were placed on a table. All of the doors were unlocked and Maud's vehicle was parked in their driveway with the keys in the ignition, the way she normally left the car for the evening. The Crawfords' dog was lying undisturbed on the floor.

Nothing seemed amiss near the residence, but there was no sign of Maud at the scene. She has never been heard from again.

Maud was very active in Camden's civic affairs in 1957 and did not have a reason to leave without warning. She was highly respected in the town at the time and there initially seemed to be no evidence to suggest foul play was involved in her case. Maud's disappearance was highly publicized due to her association with Senator McClellan.

Maud's disappearance remained shrouded in mystery until reporter Beth Brickell returned to her hometown of Camden in 1986. She wrote a series of articles for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that exposed some of the intrigue surrounding Maud's case.

Brickell found that many of the people involved were still frightened about the circumstances over 30 years after Maud vanished. She apparently received threats herself while researching the story.

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette was threatened with lawsuits from individuals after the first segment of Brickell's story was published. The newspaper ignored the efforts to stop the story and continued to run the entire series of articles.

Brickell learned that Maud was working on the estate of Rose Berg at the time of her disappearance. Rose's husband, Henry Berg, died in 1950 and left her three-quarters of his $15 million estate and one-quarter to his nephew, Henry Myar ""Mike"" Berg. A photo of Mike is posted with this case summary.

Henry and Mike's fathers were partners in a venture called Berg Brothers, which was apparently quite profitable for both of them. According to Brickell's sources, Mike believed that his father was the main contributor to Berg Brothers and thought Henry should have left him the entire interest of the estate. Rose and Henry did not have children and Henry named Rose and their accountant, George Bowers, as co-executors of his estate.

Rose had reportedly shown indications of mental incompetence during the 1940s and was not able to make decisions of her own ability by 1957. Rose depended on Maud, who was her friend and neighbor, to take care of her estate issues.

Maud created a will for Rose in 1957 that specified her portion of Henry's estate and her own property, which was valued at $5 million, would be divided among her three nieces.

There was no mention of Mike in Rose's will. He was allegedly angered by her decision, as he did not want to lose all rights to Henry's fortune and manage his portion of his uncle's estate with her relatives. Maud apparently supported Rose's decision and fought Mike's attempts to subvert Rose's wishes.

A signed copy of Rose's will was reportedly placed inside of her bank safety deposit box. Other signed copies were allegedly handed to Maud and to Bowers. Bowers told Brickell that he did have one of the signed documents in 1957. Rose's nieces apparently held unsigned documents in their possessions.

Rose required full-time nursing care by 1957 and showed symptoms of what is now regarded as Alzheimer's Disease. Maud, who had by then been appointed her legal guardian, was taking Rose's wishes very seriously and was fighting to keep her nieces listed as her beneficiaries.

This placed Maud in disagreement with Mike and his attorney, Thomas Gaughan, who was a partner in Maud's firm at the time. A photo of Gaughan is posted with this case summary.

Ethics prohibited Maud from taking any action against clients of her firm, which meant that she was forced to tread lightly around Mike. Their disagreement was never made public until the publication of Brickell's articles in 1986.

Brickell's sources told her that Mike moved bonds from Rose's safety deposit box prior to Maud's disappearance. According to the source, Gaughan had to convince Mike to return the items before anyone noticed they were missing and contacted authorities. There were many accusations flying back and forth between Rose's family and Mike's associates.

Three deeds were created for Rose's estate in 1950, but not recorded until 1954. Many people do not believe that Rose could comprehend what she was signing and that the deeds were inaccurate.

Rose handed over 21,000 acres of valuable land to Mike in the documents. Maud apparently believed Mike took advantage of Rose and was attempting to make the deeds null and void at the time of her disappearance by allowing Rose's will to stand on its own.

It is theorized that Maud's case is connected to the Berg estate matter. All of the suspected participants and witnesses are deceased and no charges have been filed against anyone. Mike, who was a member of the Arkansas State Police Commission, died in 1975.

Maud's remains have never been located and her case remains unsolved.

Geneva Verneal Adams,"July 25, 1976","Herculaneum, Missouri",53,White/Caucasian,"5'0"" - 5'2""
",110 lbs - 120 lbs,"Adams was last seen at the Artesian Lounge in Herculaneum, Missouri on July 25, 1976. She asked her daughter to drive her there so she could meet Jimmie Lee Mills, a man she'd met earlier, who was a regular patron of the bar. At the bar, Adams danced with Mills and appeared to be very happy. Mills offered to drive her home.

She has never been heard from again. Mills later said they left at closing time; he said they went to an an after-hours bar in East St. Louis, Missouri, but it was closed and he dropped her off at a donut shop on Highway 61 in Crystal City, Missouri at 4:00 a.m. A photo of Mills is posted below this case summary.

Mills was convicted of attempted rape and was released from prison in 1975, a year before Adams disappeared. At the time she went missing, he was out on bail awaiting trial for the rape of a teenage girl. He was convicted and received probation and a suspended sentence in that case. He had later convictions for receiving stolen property, escape, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Another woman associated with Mills, 21-year-old Cynthia Horan, disappeared from her St. Louis, Missouri apartment in July 1985. Horan lived next door to Mills, and he was investigated as a possible suspect in her disappearance, but there was insufficient evidence to charge him.

Horan's remains were found in a shallow grave in Jefferson County, Missouri in 1988, but they weren't identified until 2011. No one has been charged in her case. Mills maintains his innocence in Adams's disappearance and says he has no idea what happened to her. He is currently in prison and scheduled to be released in 2019.

Adams was born and raised in Arkansas, and she lived in Festus, Missouri at the time of her disappearance. She has ten children, two of whom were still living at home at the time of her disappearance, and she was a devoted member of the Pentecostal Church. She was married twice; her first husband died in 1969 and her second marriage ended in divorce.

She didn't drink much and it was uncharacteristic of her to go to bars, as she did on the night of her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.",http://charleyproject.org/case/geneva-verneal-adams,-90.38012,38.268388

Allen was at the apartment when her friend left for work, and the friend spoke to her on the telephone that day while Allen was at the home. When Allen's friend returned, Allen was missing.

Authorities stated Allen is missing under suspicious circumstances and may be in danger. It is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. All of her belongings were left behind, including her purse and a tax return check for $2,000.

On the day of her disappearance she went to a job interview at a telemarketing company on Watson Road and made an appointment for a second interview; she was looking for work closer to her St. Louis, Missouri home. Allen was a nursing student at the time of her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.

Although she may have left of her own accord and some agencies classify her as a runaway, foul play is now suspected in Peggy's disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.

Abby Jo Blagg,"November 12, 2001","Grand Junction, Colorado",6,Caucasian / White,"4'0""",44 lbs,"Abby, her father, Michael Francis Blagg, and her mother, Jennifer Loman Blagg, resided in the Redlands area west of Grand Junction, Colorado in 2001. The family lived in a home in the 2200 block of Pine Terrace Court.

Photos of Michael, Jennifer and the Blaggs' former house are posted with this case summary. Michael was employed as an operations director for the Dixson division of Ametek, Inc. Jennifer was a stay-at-home mother and often participated in exercise classes and religious studies, as well as volunteer work with Abby's class.

Michael told authorities that Abby went to sleep in her bedroom at approximately 7:00 p.m. on November 12, 2001. He said that Jennifer received a phone call from a neighbor regarding a possible lunch date the following day at 8:00 p.m. Michael stated that he and Jennifer went to bed by 10:00 p.m.; he said that there was no indication of anything amiss during the overnight hours.

Michael said that he departed for work at approximately 6:00 a.m. on November 13. He claimed that his wife and daughter were asleep when he left the house. Michael told investigators that he called home periodically during the day to speak to Jennifer, but no one answered the phone at their residence. He said he was concerned about her apparent absence by the late afternoon hours, but he did not believe that anything was wrong.

Michael said that he returned home by 4:00 p.m. and noticed that there were signs of a struggle inside the residence. A large amount of blood was on the mattress in the master bedroom, but there was no sign of Jennifer or Abby. Michael called authorities at 4:20 p.m. and the residence was sealed off as a potential crime scene.

Investigators learned that an unidentified individual called Bookcliff Christian School and told administrators that Abby would be absent from class on November 13. Authorities read Jennifer's journals, hoping that her private thoughts may provide evidence as to their whereabouts. The diaries were reportedly full of Biblical references.

Michael moved out of their home in December 2001, stating that it was difficult to remain in the house without his wife and daughter. He told authorities that a portion of Jennifer's jewelry had allegedly been stolen from the residence on the day Jennifer and Abby disappeared. He claimed that he did not realize the jewelry was missing until January 2002, nearly two months after they vanished. Michael suggested their disappearances were connected to a series of burglaries that occurred in the Grand Junction area in late 2001.

Authorities placed Michael under surveillance in late November 2001. A camera allegedly recorded him stealing a shredder and a table, worth over $500 altogether, from his employer in January 2002. Authorities questioned Michael about the incident in February 2002. He attempted to take his own life the following day by slashing his wrists. He left a note denying any knowledge of Abby and Jennifer's disappearances.

Michael was taken to the hospital in serious condition; his condition stabilized and he was released after one week. Michael maintains his innocence in Jennifer and Abby's cases, but he was publicly identified as a possible suspect after his suicide attempt.

His family members and friends supported him after his wife and daughter vanished, but opinions over his possible connection to the case began to change in early 2002. Michael's employment was terminated in late February 2002. He hired an attorney and said that he planned to look for a new job.

Officials questioned friends and relatives of the Blaggs in Arizona, California, South Carolina and Texas as part of the investigation. Authorities announced that they believed Jennifer and Abby were the victims of foul play in late March 2002.

Investigators said that they believed the family's maroon and gold 2000 Ford Windstar was involved in the disappearances. A photo of the vehicle is posted with this case summary. Investigators believe that the minivan may have been used to transport Jennifer and Abby from their residence in November 2001. The vehicle was parked inside the family's garage at the time they were reported missing.

An anonymous female caller contacted authorities several times after Jennifer and Abby's disappearance. The informant claimed she saw the minivan in an area near Park Ridge, Colorado on the day of their disappearances. Investigators asked the caller to contact them again with additional details during the spring of 2002.

Authorities announced that they planned to search in a 45-mile area near the Blaggs' home in early April 2002. Officials said that the search was limited to areas accessible by a two-wheel drive, low-clearance vehicle. The family's Winstar matched that description. The search lasted 12 days, but no evidence related to the case was discovered.

Officials continued to search around the Grand Junction area for clues related to the Blaggs' investigation through the early summer of 2002. Jennifer's remains were discovered in the Mesa County landfill on June 5, 2002. There was no evidence of Abby's body at the scene and authorities are not certain if her remains will be located in the future.

Michael was residing with his mother in Georgia at the time of the discovery. He was charged with first-degree murder in his wife's case shortly after her body was identified. Michael returned to Colorado to face the charges. Authorities concluded that Jennifer was killed by a gunshot to her left eye. Officials believe that she was murdered while she slept, as her dental retainer was discovered with her remains. Jennifer only wore the device while she was sleeping.

An employee of Colorado Legal Services in Grand Junction recognized Jennifer and Abby's photos and contacted investigators in late 2001. The worker stated that Jennifer visited the office several days prior to their disappearances and claimed that she was being abused by her husband and was frightened. The employee said that Jennifer had wanted to end her marriage. The witness said Jennifer was unable to see an attorney immediately, and she became upset and left.

Investigators stated that Jennifer's body was located in landfill trash collected from Michael's former employer in November 2001. One of his former co-workers told authorities that he saw Michael pushing a pallet jack with two large-sized cardboard boxes on it on the day he reported Jennifer and Abby as missing. The witness stated that Michael discarded the items on the loading dock near Ametek's trash compactor. Michael refused an offer of assistance with the boxes, which was uncharacteristic of his behavior.

Documents released in mid-June 2002 revealed that the owner of a local escort service told authorities that Michael visited her business several times monthly for massages administered by topless women. Investigators discovered numerous pornographic images on Michael's home computer; he claimed that he and Jennifer were having sexual problems in late 2001 and he was conducting research online.

Authorities also stated that Michael likely abused Jennifer and investigators believed that her murder was premeditated. Officials said that Abby was probably an ancillary victim of the attack. Trace amounts of Jennifer's blood were found on the exterior and interior of the Blaggs' van, including on the steering wheel, but none of Abby's blood could be found anywhere, either in the van or in the house.

Authorities announced that Michael appeared to nearly confess to his wife and daughter's murders during questioning in February 2002. Documents stated that Michael began crying during the interview session and inquired as to the penalities for murder categories. He requested to speak with attorney before continuing with the session and departed police headquarters afterwards. Michael's suicide attempt occurred later that evening.

Michael was tried for Jennifer's murder in the spring of 2004. His defense attorneys argued that she was killed by an intruder. Prosecutors produced witnesses to indicate that Jennifer and Michael's relationship was troubled and that her murder and Abby's disappearance had all the marks of a staged burglary. Jennifer's mother testified, saying Jennifer had once told her Michael choked her while he was drunk.

On April 16, 2004, after twelve hours of jury deliberation, Michael was convicted of murdering his wife. He was sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was upheld on appeal in 2008.

Abby remains missing. Michael has never been charged in connection with her disappearance. Foul play is suspected in Abby's case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/abby-jo-blagg,-108.5537386,39.059872

Brenda Y. Cisneros,"September 17, 2004","Nuevo Laredo, Mexico",23,Hispanic / Latina,"5'5""",,"Cisernos and a friend, Yvette Martinez, left their homes in Laredo, Texas and went to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico on September 17, 2004 to attend a concert in celebration of Cisneros's birthday. They crossed the border at 11:11 p.m. and a relative saw them later at the concert.

A friend of the women spoke to them by cellular phone at 4:00 a.m. on September 18; they said they were only a short distance from the border and would be back in Texas in a few minutes. Cisneros and Martinez never arrived home and have never been heard from again.

Martinez's stepfather went to Nuevo Laredo to search for the women because he did not feel the Mexican police were looking hard enough. He found Martinez's white 2001 Mitsubishi Galant at a tow yard run by the local police in the city on October 8. The rear bumper had paint on it and the car's stereo and battery were missing.

Investigators believe Martinez and Cisneros met with foul play in Mexico. The border area is rife with crime, much of it drug-related, and many American tourists have disappeared or been killed in border towns in the past several years. Few leads are available in Cisneros and Martinez's cases, however. They remain unsolved.

Marie Ann Blee,"November 21, 1979","Craig, Colorado",15,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",100 lbs - 115 lbs,"Marie attended a 4-H dance at the Pavilion in Craig, Colorado on November 21, 1979. Afterwards she went to a party at the Shadow Mountain Village mobile home park with her friend, Marty Dean Doolin. Some of Marie's female friends were with them also, and became alarmed because people at the party were using drugs and most of the guests were male. Marie's girlfriends decided to leave as a result, but Marie elected to stay.

Doolin later told investigators that Marie said she had a ride back to her hometown of Hayden, Colorado with an unidentified driver between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. on November 21. Doolin stated that this was the last time he saw Marie.

Other witnesses placed Marie at a store in Craig in the early morning hours; however, many of the partygoers' statements conflicted one another and there is still confusion as to when Marie was last seen. Marie's parents filed a missing person's report with the police in Hayden when she did not return home the following morning. She has never been heard from again.

Police initially suspected that Marie had run away from home, but her parents said it was not in her character to do so. Authorities have admitted the initial investigation into her disappearance was mishandled and crucial witnesses and possible suspects were not interviewed.

A week after Marie's disappearance, Doolin was arrested on extortion charges. He admitted to calling Marie's family and demanding $5,000 for their daughter's safe return. Doolin pleaded guilty to telephone harassment and was sentenced to six months in jail and two years on probation. He was later convicted of an unrelated sexual assault. He maintains that he knows nothing about Marie's disappearance and made the call only to give her family hope that she was still alive.

Numerous rumors have circulated about Marie's disappearance, ranging from voluntary disappearance to murder. There has been speculation for years that Marie died of a drug overdose at the party and her body was buried somewhere in Craig. Authorities said that witnesses' statements supported that theory. Her case was reopened by authorities in 1999, but excavations to this point have been unsuccessful at locating any evidence connected to her disappearance.

Authorities eventually identified two persons of interest in Marie's disappearance besides Doolin: Max Abel Garcia and Stephen ""Steve"" Skufca. All of them denied involvement in her case. A photo of Skufca is posted with this case summary. He was later convicted of drug charges and sentenced to twelve years in prison, then paroled to live with his mother. He died in an accident in 2012. To the end he maintained his innocence in Marie's disappearance.

Marie was a sophomore at Hayden High School at the time she went missing; she was a good student. She is a former Girl Scout and a member of 4-H, and she helped manage her school wrestling team. Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.",http://charleyproject.org/case/marie-ann-blee,-107.546454,40.515249
Amanda Alexandra Adlai,"December 26, 2008","West Bloomfield, Michigan",7,White/Caucasian,"3'8""",50 lbs,"Amanda disappeared from West Bloomfield, Michigan on December 26, 2008. She was abducted by her non-custodial father, Victor Nathan Adlai. A felony warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was issued for him on February 24, 2009.

Brittney Ann Beers,"September 16, 1997","Sturgis, MI",6,White,"4'0""",45 lbs,"Brittney was playing outside of her family's residence at Village Manor Apartments during the evening hours of September 16, 1997. She went outside to ride her bicycle at approximately 7:30 p.m. Brittney's mother, Tina Stetler, left to run errands at approximately 8:30 p.m. and saw her daughter riding her bicycle around the neighborhood at that time.

Brittney's half-brother told authorities he saw his sister sitting on a bench about five minutes after their mother departed. A witness told investigators that he saw Brittney speaking to an unidentified male driving a red or brown mid-size vehicle shortly thereafter. Brittney walked over to the witness and told him that she ""made a new friend."" Brittney has never been seen again.

Stetler returned home at approximately 9:05 p.m. and asked Brittney's brother to find her. The authorities were summoned when the child could not be located near the apartment complex, which is located on U.S. 12, the major thoroughfare through Sturgis. Brittney's bicycle was discovered abandoned shortly after she was last seen.

Sketches of the unidentified man seen speaking to Brittney were distributed through the area in the days following her disappearance. It is not known if the man is connected to her case. He was in his late twenties or early thirties with short dark hair and a thick mustache and was driving either a mid-sized red car or a brown Renault. Police are still looking for the man; he is not being called a suspect, but a witness whom they would like to question.

Michigan courts removed Brittney's older brother and younger sister from the family's home in 1998 after allegations of child physical and sexual abuse and neglect were issued. Brittney's father, Raymond Beers; his brother, James Beers; and Kevin Folsom, the father of one of her half-brothers, were allegedly involved in the abuse of the children. Folsom was imprisoned for molesting Brittney, but he was released in 2008.

Brittney's case received more publicity in 2000 after the arrest of a St. Clair Shores, Michigan man who had images of child pornography saved on his computer. One of the victims resembled Brittney, but was later determined not to be the missing girl.

Brittney's case remains open and unsolved.

Nikole Betterson,"December 1, 1977","Dearborn, Michigan",2,"African American / Black, Caucasian / White",,,"Nikole's mother, Susan Klingel, was killed in a car accident in September 1977. Nikole and her father, Jarrett Betterson, were also in the accident but were not seriously injured. Jarrett and Klingel never married and shortly after her death he began dating another woman.

Klingel's parents last saw Nikole at around Christmastime in 1977. Jarrett announced that he and his new girlfriend, Barbara, were moving West. There were conflicting accounts as to whether their intended destination was California or Las Vegas, Nevada. The Klingels never heard from any of them again.

In 1997, the Klingels hired a private investigator to locate Nikole. The investigator found Jarrett and Barbara, who were now married, living in poverty and poor health in Las Vegas, but there was no trace of Nikole and no paper trail for her whatsoever, except her Social Security orphan's benefits, which her father picked up every month until Nikole turned 18.

The private investigator contacted the Las Vegas police department, which opened an investigation, checking school, court, police, licensure and adoption records. Their investigation turned up no evidence that Nikole was alive after she left Michigan.

In November 1997, a Las Vegas police detective visited Jarrett. He lied, claiming he knew what happened to Nikole, and promised them leniency if Jarrett told the whole story. Jarrett promised to contact the detective within a short time and confess what happened to his daughter. Ten days later, he called the detective and asked for more time. Jarrett never contacted the police again. He shot his wife to death and then himself.

Before her death, Barbara mailed a letter to Nikole's grandmother asking for forgiveness ""all the wounds we have put in your hearts with our tragic and youthful blunders."" She included a money order for $900 to pay for her and Jarrett's cremations.

Jarrett and Barbara's deaths have stalled the investigation into Nikole's disappearance, as without their involvement authorities have no evidence that a crime was even committed. Foul play is suspected in Nikole's case; it remains unsolved.

Kellie Marie Brownlee,"May 20, 1982","Novi, Michigan",17,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",125 lbs - 135 lbs,"Kellie was staying with her boyfriend, Mark Graves, and his family in their apartment in Walled Lake, Michigan in May 1982. She had moved out of her family's West Bloomfield, Michigan home after telling friends that her stepfather, Paul Brownlee, abused her. Her friends stated that they had seen bruises on Kellie's body before she vanished.

Paul had pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct in 1977 when Kellie's older sister Kim filed charges against him. Kim then moved to California, where the girls' biological father resided. Kellie remained in Michigan, where she had a good relationship with their mother, Loretta.

Kellie had occasionally moved out of the family's home after problems with Paul came to the forefront. Loretta stated that Kellie was planning to move back to West Bloomfield once Paul left the residence. Loretta did not divorce Paul until 1985, three years after Kellie disappeared, but there were apparently ongoing discussions about the plan at the time.

Kellie and Graves took the bus together to their high school on May 20, 1982. Kellie skipped classes that day and hitchhiked to the Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Michigan, where she proceeded to apply for jobs at several stores. Kellie listed the Brownlees' residence as her address on all of her applications.

A friend's mother saw her at the mall and offered her a ride, but Kellie declined. She said that she planned to place more applications before going home. It's unclear if she was returning to the Graves' or the Brownlees' residence. This was the last confirmed sighting of Kellie.

Graves reported that Kellie was missing when she did not return to his family's apartment or call him by 9:00 p.m. A search was initiated soon after, but little evidence was located. Graves was ruled out as a suspect early on in the investigation.

Speculation began to center around Paul Brownlee, who claimed that he was visiting his father-in-law's grave and going to the gym on the day Kellie disappeared. Paul also denied abusing Kellie in any way and maintained he had nothing to do with her disappearance. Paul placed a $1,000 reward for information about his stepdaughter's disappearance in June of 1982.

Paul agreed to a police interview in July 1982 and again stated he was innocent. He retained an attorney and refused to submit to a polygraph test the same month. Having little evidence to implicate Paul other than rumors of abuse towards Kellie, investigators began to look elsewhere for clues. They suspected that counterfeiting operator James Mitchell DeBardeleben may have had a connection to Kellie's case.

DeBardeleben's residence was searched by United States Secret Service agents in November 1983 in northern Virginia. There investigators located numerous journals, audio tapes and photos of various women in sadomasochistic activities against their will. DeBardeleben was suspected of attacking and murdering many women, as well as conducting his counterfeiting ring. He apparently liked brunette females and hitchhikers, both of which fit Kellie's mold.

Photos were given to Loretta for purposes of attempting to identify Kellie, but there was not a connection. DeBardeleben has since been ruled out as a suspect in Kellie's case. It is worth noting that he did not cooperate with authorities in their investigation of another young brunette's disappearance, Judith Chartier. DeBardeleben remains as a suspect in that case.

Paul continues to maintain that he is innocent and not connected to Kellie's disappearance. He occasionally hands what he considers to be leads over to authorities in West Bloomfield, who still want to re-interview Paul about the case. He continues to refuse their requests.

In 2018, authorities announced Arthur Ream was a possible suspect in Kelly's case and in the disappearances of Cynthia Coon, Kimberly King, Kim Larrow and Nadine O'Dell. A photo of Ream is posted with this case summary.

He was convicted of sexual assault in the 1970s and, in 1986, murdered Cindy Zarzycki, a thirteen-year-old girl who was dating his son. He was convicted of her murder and afterwards, in 2008, he lead authorities to her body, which was buried in a shallow grave 30 miles from Detroit, Michigan.

While in prison, Ream reportedly told cellmates he was serial killer with four to six victims. In May 2018, police began digging at the same property where Cindy had been buried, expecting to find the bodies of other missing girls there. No human remains were located, however, and the digging stopped after a week. All the cases remain unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/kellie-marie-brownlee,-83.470131,42.492018

Diane Faye Chorba,"May 24, 1979","Luther, MI",30,White,"5'6""",120 lbs,"Chorba's relatives reported her missing on July 20, 1979. They hadn't heard from her in approximately two months. She had moved to the Luther, Michigan area and was seeing a married man, Clarence Oliver Bean Jr., known as Ollie.

A photo of Ollie is posted with this case summary. Chobra already had a young son by him and was pregnant with another. She also had a teenage daughter. Authorities determined she was last seen on May 24.

When police interviewed Ollie, he stated Chorba was going to go to California with an unidentified woman. They took Flight 191 out of Chicago, Illinois on May 25, 1979. The plane crashed while leaving O'Hare Airport in Chicago, killing all 271 passengers and crew, as well as two people on the ground. It was one of the worst air disasters in U.S. history.

Chorba's family hired an attorney to help find her body among the victims, but the coroner investigating the crash said she wasn't on the plane.

In May 1980, before authorities could give Ollie a polygraph test to prove his story, he moved to Oregon with his family, including his and Chorba's son. He was subsequently interviewed there, but provided no more information as to Chorba's whereabouts.

He and his wife, Judy, eventually divorced after a 32-year marriage. Judy stated Ollie was abusive and had openly flaunted his relationship with Chorba. In spite of, this the two women were friendly with each other, and it was Judy who took care of Chorba's children in the immediate aftermath of her disappearance.

In 1999, Judy told investigators her husband had shot Chorba to death. On May 24, 1979, Ollie had driven her to show to her Chorba's grave at the end of a remote road in the woods near Bristol, Michigan. He had cut down a large tree to conceal the burial site, and buried her face-down after removing her jewelry.

Ollie was charged with murder, and Judy testified against him at the trial. A forensic pathologist also testified, stating all the victims of of the Flight 191 crash had been identified and Chorba was not among them. Ollie maintained Chorba had still gone to California, even if not on Flight 191, and when he last saw her she was safe and well.

Ollie was convicted of second-degree murder in August 2001.

Chorba's son was killed in a car accident in 2004, but her daughter is still alive and has three children of her own. Her daughter said never believed her mother had abandoned her, and was certain of Ollie's guilt.

Chorba's body has never been found, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.

Denman's husband Henry Lee Harbison, also known as Henry Johnson, disappeared at the same time as his family. They were not reported missing until March 1975, five months after their disappearance. It was the family's landlord that told the police they had disappeared. Police found Denman's clothes still in the closet of their residence. Harbison's clothes and clothes of the children were missing, however. Blood was also found on a cushion in the home, but laboratory tests on the stain were inconclusive.

It is suspected that Harbison may have murdered his family. His affiliates at the Church of the New Song claim the entire family was murdered. Denman's family believes Denman was murdered and the children were given away.

Both the Independence police department and the FBI were involved in investigating the Denman/Johnson disappearances.

She came home at 10:00 p.m. after seeing her brother's baseball game. A short time later, Gina said she was going for a ride on her ten-speed girls' bicycle. She never returned. Her disappearance was reported at 2:00 a.m.

Gina was seen standing near her church when a battered light gray, green or blue station wagon with Missouri license plates pulled up and the driver spoke to her. She got back on her bike and turned south on Mine La Motte. Later, some witnesses including Gina's boyfriend heard someone screaming for help.

A vehicle was seen turning left on Franklin and driving towards Highway 67. Gina's bicycle was found abandoned on a residential lawn on High Street, five blocks from her home, later in the evening. There was no sign of her and she has not been seen again.

Three men were implicated in Gina's disappearance in 1998. Nathan D. ""Danny"" Williams was charged with Gina's murder in 1999. Investigators stated that Williams was identified by a witness as the man who was seated in the back of the station wagon with Gina the night she was abducted. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

Witnesses also identified Bryant Squires as the driver of the station wagon; he has since died of cancer and AIDS-related complications. He allegedly made a deathbed statement to nurses implicating Williams and himself in Gina's abduction and murder and in other crimes.

Timothy R. Bellew, a friend of both Williams and Squires, was initially implicated in Gina's disappearance as well. Bellew admitted he lied to FBI agents about the location of Gina's remains. He claimed Gina was buried in an abandoned meat freezer on his father's 96-acre property, but extensive searches of the area through 2001 have not produced any evidence.

Williams pleaded not guilty to the first-degree murder charge against him in 1999. Authorities believe that he was the person responsible for killing Gina in 1989 by slitting her throat, and Squires and Bellew helped him cover up the crime. Both Williams and Bellew have records of sex offenses and other crimes. Bellew was charged with second-degree murder in Gina's case.

The murder charge against Bellew was dropped for lack of evidence in 1999, and he was charged instead with lying to investigators about where Gina's body was buried. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in prison. In 2003, the murder charge against Williams was also dropped. He remains in prison, serving a life sentence for forcible rape and forcible sodomy.

Authorities still believe the men were involved in Gina's presumed murder, but stated there is not enough evidence to convict them at trial. Williams had also been charged in the 1975 murder of a young woman; that charge was also dropped for lack of evidence in 1998, ten days before the trial was set to begin. He's also a suspect in the 1979 disappearance of twelve-year-old Tammy Surdam.

She worked for a ski shop and part time as a ski instructor at the time of her disappearance. She had lived in the Vail area for several years. Cunningham disappeared early in the evening after she left her apartment in the Apollo Park neighborhood to visit a local tavern. She has never been heard from again.

Although he was never charged in her case, Cunningham is believed to have been a victim of the serial killer Ted Bundy. A photograph of Bundy is posted with this case summary. He was executed in Florida in 1989 and confessed to many murders before his death, including Cunningham's. She fits the profile of his other victims.

Bundy stated he lured Cunningham into his vehicle by posing as an injured skier on crutches and asking her to help carry his ski boots. Feigning injury was a common technique for him. He knocked her unconscious, drove her to a remote area about eighty miles west of Vail and raped her.

Bundy stated Cunningham regained consciousness at some point and tried to escape, but he caught her. He strangled her before disposing of her body in a shallow grave near Rife, Colorado. Bundy said the gravesite was in a high desert area with a circular drive and some large trees. In April 1989, a team of experts who specialized in finding bodies brought a bloodhound to a likely spot, but their search didn't turn up anything of interest.

Bundy is a suspect in the murders of Nancy Baird, Ann Marie Burr, Lynette Culver, Susan Curtis, Georgeann Hawkins, Vicki Hollar, Rita Jolly, Donna Manson, Denise Oliverson, Nancy Wilcox, and many other girls and young women. The women continue to be listed as missing persons. Their remains have never been recovered.

On August 30, 1974, Davis signed the divorce papers. She was granted custody of the couple's children, but she told relatives she planned to move to California, where she had lived before her marriage, and would leave the children with their father.

At 7:00 p.m., she began weeping and left the family's trailer, leaving her husband and children at home watching television. They assumed she had gone down the road to use a pay phone; she had done so the night before and had been gone three hours.

Davis did not have any money, identification or extra clothing with her when she disappeared. She never returned to her family's residence has never been heard from again.

Her husband reported her missing the next day. He was initially considered a suspect in her disappearance, but he passed a lie detector test and is no longer under suspicion. Dogs repeatedly tracked Davis's scent from her trailer to the pay phone down the road, but they may have simply been following an old trail, as she walked that route frequently.

Suicide was considered a possibility in her case. Davis's husband found a note she had written, apologizing to him for the failure of their marriage. The note did not insinuate suicide and it was undated. If she did in fact take her own life, her body has not been discovered, which is highly unusual.

A photo of Funke is posted with this case summary. In September 2011, Armstrong's sister became concerned because she hadn't heard from her in a long time. Whenever she called the house, Funke would provide various excuses as to why Armstrong was unable to talk to her.

Her sister visited Armstrong's local hangouts and talked to her friends and neighbors, and realized no one had seen or heard from her. She asked the police to conduct a welfare check, but they were unable to get in touch with Armstrong either. Her sister then reported her missing on September 26.

The following day, the police went to Funke and Armstrong's residence with a search warrant and found bloodstained carpeting, but no sign of Armstrong, Funte or their son. They did not declare the trailer to be a crime scene at that time. On September 28, Funke was arrested on unrelated charges. He had been under house arrest but had cut off his ankle monitor and left home.

One of his cellmates claims Funke told him he had killed Armstrong, and a friend of Funke's said he saw bloodstains in the trailer and Funke asked him to help dispose of some evidence. Authorities went back to the trailer and took the stains to test for DNA; the blood was Armstrong's.

In January 2012, Funke confessed to killing Armstrong in an argument. He said they had been arguing for three days and he killed her after she hit him with a hammer while he was sleeping. Funke stated he put her body in a trash container and it was picked up a short time afterwards. Investigators believe Armstrong probably died on July 8, but her family claims she was alive after that time and called her sister on August 2.

Authorities searched a local landfill for Armstrong's body, but found nothing. In late February, Funke was charged with voluntary manslaughter. He pleaded guilty, stating Armstrong had attacked him with a hammer and he killed her in self-defense. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.

Armstrong's body has never been found and the police have stopped looking for it. They believe her body is in the Wabash Valley Landfill, but they'd only be willing to search for it if her family paid the costs, estimated at $7,000 a day.

Patricia Blough,"July 2, 1966","Indiana Dunes State Park, Indiana",19,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",115 lbs,"Blough and two of her friends, Ann Miller and Renee Bruhl, drove to the Indiana Dunes State Park in Indiana on July 2, 1966. Miller picked Blough up from her family's residence on Drury Lane in Westchester, Illinois at approximately 8:00 a.m. Blough told her mother the women planned to return home early in the evening to allow Bruhl time to prepare dinner for her husband.

Miller and Blough picked up Bruhl from her home on the west side of Chicago, Illinois and stopped at a drugstore to purchase suntan lotion. The women arrived at the Indiana Dunes State Park at approximately 10:00 a.m. They were driving Miller's four-door 1955 Buick, which Miller parked in the lot. The women hiked to a spot in the park approximately 100 yards from the Lake Michigan shoreline.

A couple reported seeing the women leave their belongings on the beach at approximately 12:00 p.m. and enter the lake together. The witnesses saw them speaking to an unidentified man operating a 14- to 16-foot-long white boat with a blue interior and and outboard motor sometime afterwards.

The couple reported their observations to a park ranger around dusk when they noticed that the women's belongings were still sitting unclaimed on the beach. The witnesses stated that the women went aboard the boat and headed west with the driver. Blough, Miller and Bruhl have never been seen again.

Blough left a yellow robe, sunglasses, a transistor radio, a white print towel and her wallet containing five dollars on the beach. The three women's belongings were collected by the ranger the night of their disappearance and stored in the Park Superintendent's offices until two days later on July 4, 1966. Blough's father called the office on that day, asking if anyone had seen the women.

The park rangers soon learned that missing persons' reports had been filed for Blough, Miller and Bruhl over the weekend in Illinois by their families. The rangers began investigating the park and located Miller's Buick in the parking lot. Her car keys had been located with her belongings and some items of the women's clothing and other personal effects were still inside the vehicle. The car was apparently parked in its original space from July 2. The park rangers contacted other law enforcement agencies, including the United States Coast Guard.

A search for the missing women was initiated on July 5, three days after the women disappeared. Additional witnesses came forward with conflicting stories regarding the women's last known movements, but authorities believe that the first witnesses' reports stating that the women were seen boarding a boat were the most reliable.

The search was extended to a six-mile stretch of beach west of the state park near the Ogden Dunes later in the week. More witnesses began substantiating the initial reports that the women entered a white boat operated by an unidentified man. Later accounts described the male as in his early twenties with a tanned complexion and dark, wavy hair. He was wearing a beach jacket at the time. A visitor was filming home movies at the state park on July 2 and offered his reels to investigators.

The search was immediately narrowed to two boats once authorities viewed the footage. One was a fiberglass 16- to 18-foot-long trimaran runabout with a three-hulled design, which was operated by a man fitting the description of the unidentified driver. Three females matching the missing women were seen aboard the smaller boat in the footage.

The second boat identified was a 26- to 28-foot-long Trojan cabin cruiser with three men aboard along with three women. The cabin cruiser was seen at approximately 3:00 p.m. three hours after the women entered the smaller vessel.

Investigators believe that the women may have been dropped off on the beach by the driver of the smaller boat while he drove back to retrieve two male friends and the cabin cruiser. Blough, Miller and Bruhl were reportedly seen eating and walking along the sand dunes after this time.

They were approached by another unidentified man, who accompanied them on to the cabin cruiser. Witnesses stated that the cabin cruiser was equipped with a radio/telephone antenna, but apparently did not have a name printed on its stern. This final sighting has never been confirmed, but is considered reliable by authorities.

Investigators began researching the women's backgrounds in an attempt to discover if their disappearances were voluntary. Authorities found that there may have been problems in Bruhl's marriage, though her family denied it. All three women were horse enthusiasts, which pointed to a possible connection with criminal activity.

Blough owned a thoroughbred, Hank, who won a race in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada two weeks prior to the women's disappearance. Hank also won $900 in another race the weekend the women vanished; the earnings were never collected by Blough. Blough previously owned a saddle horse that she boarded at the same stable where Miller's horse resided, which is how the two met each other. Bruhl had been a high school classmate of Blough's.

Blough attended Proviso East High School in Hillside, Illinois for two years prior to transferring to Proviso West High School in Maywood, Illinois for her graduation. She was employed for six months as a secretary at Sears, Roebuck and Company before accepting a secretarial job at Commonwealth Edison at the time she vanished.

Blough was a very skilled swimmer who could swim 20 to 30 miles; Miller was thought to possess similar abilities and Bruhl's family stated that she had fair swimming skills. Accidental drowning was considered a possibility in the disappearances, but an unlikely one.

Blough's friends told authorities that she had a facial injury which may have been inflicted by a fist in March 1966, approximately four months before she disappeared. When questioned as to what happened, Blough told her friends she was having problems with ""horse syndicate people,"" but did not detail her explanation.

Blough's former boyfriend, John Paul Jones, was an ex-convict and a rodeo cowboy. He lived in California at the time Blough disappeared and maintained his innocence in the women's cases. Jones was never proven to be involved in the disappearances. In addition, both Blough and Miller knew other people with criminal records due to their associations with the horse market.

Both women returned to their residence shortly before dawn on the day of their disappearances; it is not known if their activities during the early morning hours of July 2 are connected to their disappearances. A friend of Blough's claimed that Blough said she was going to stage her own disappearance in 1966 and never intended to be located.

Miller's friends told authorities that she was three months pregnant in July of 1966 and mentioned entering a home for unwed mothers prior to her disappearance. Blough may have been pregnant as well. The two women's boyfriends were reportedly both married.

Another person who visited the beach that day was Ralph Largo Jr. He resembled the boat driver Miller, Blough and Bruhl were seen speaking to shortly before they disappeared. He lived with his aunt and uncle in Gary, Indiana. Largo's aunt and uncle performed abortions, which were illegal at the time.

One theory about the women's disappearances is that they went with Largo to a larger boat several miles offshore to get abortions for Miller and Blough, and something went wrong with the procedures and the women were killed and dumped into the lake. This theory has not been confirmed. Largo died in Florida in 2009.

There have been many unconfirmed sightings of the three women throughout the years, but leads never surfaced. The boats they were reportedly seen boarding on July 2, 1966 have never been located, nor have the unidentified men spotted on the vessels been seen again.

Debris from an apparent boat wreck were discovered near the Bailly Generating Station of Northern Indiana Public Service Company on Lake Michigan shortly after the July 2 disappearances. There were no reports of any missing boats the day the women vanished and authorities do not know if the debris is connected to their cases.

Blough, Miller and Bruhl frequently rode horses at Tri Color Stables in Palatine, Illinois in 1966. The stables were owned by George Jayne, a prominent horse dealer. George and his brother, Silas Jayne, were involved in a bitter argument over horse dealing during the mid-1960's. Cheryl Ann Rude, a young woman associated with the horse market, was killed at Tri Color Stables in June 1965 by a car bomb discovered to be intended for George. George asked Rude to move his Cadillac from the stable entrance and the bomb exploded.

Investigators have explored the possibility that Blough, Miller and/or Bruhl may have witnessed the bomb being planted one year prior to their disappearances. This theory may explain Blough's odd remarks about her facial injury from March 1966 and the connection to ""syndicate"" people. It has never been proven. George and Silas's phone numbers were discovered in the belongings of one of the missing women in 1966.

George was killed by a gunshot wound in 1970; Silas was later convicted of conspiracy in his brother's murder and imprisoned. Silas died in 1987; he is also a suspect in the 1977 disappearance and probable murder of Helen Brach. In 1997, James Blottiaux was charged with planting the 1965 car bomb that killed Rude at George's stable. None of the men have been proven to have been involved with Blough, Miller and Bruhl's disappearances, but it does lead to speculation that something may have occurred to cause the three women to vanish.

Silas Jayne reportedly told a sheriff that he had three bodies buried underneath his residence some time after the women's 1966 disappearances. Law enforcement took the comment seriously and planned to search Silas's property; the sheriff involved was killed in a farming accident before the search took place. As a result, the lead was left cold.

The Indiana Dunes State Park where Blough, Miller and Bruhl were last seen is now called the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Their cases remain open but inactive and unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/patricia-blough,-87.054634,41.652136
Betty Jean Ann Carlton,"July 12, 2008","Bloomfield, Indiana",41,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",170 lbs,"Carlton was last seen standing in knee-deep water in the White River under the Veteran's Memorial Bridge in Elliston, Indiana at 5:11 p.m. on July 12, 2008. She lived on Seminary Street in Bloomfield, Indiana at the time of her disappearance. Various people called the authorities to report that they'd seen her behaving oddly on July 11 - 12.

There were sightings of a person in a life jacket floating in the river on July 13, but it's unclear whether this person was Carlton. She has never been heard from again.

Carlton was facing misdemeanor and felony charges at the time of her disappearance in connection with an incident earlier in July; she called 911 for help, then allegedly attacked the police officer who responded to the call. She failed to appear at a scheduled court hearing on a few days after she went missing, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. It's unclear whether her disappearance is connected to the criminal case.

The circumstances of Carlton's disappearance are unclear; authorities are uncertain whether she drowned or if other factors caused her to go missing. Her case remains unsolved.

Debra Jean Cole,"August 29, 1981","Lebanon, Indiana",12,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",115 lbs,"Debra was last seen at her family's residence in Lebanon, Indiana on August 29, 1981 at approximately 11:00 a.m. She was allegedly with her mother's live-in boyfriend, Omer R. ""Steve"" Beebout.

Debra disappeared during the day and has never been heard from again. She left all of her personal belongings inside her home. Her mother initially reported her missing on August 31, 1981, two days after her daughter was last seen. Her case was originally classified as that of a runaway.

Debra's case was reclassified to a non-family abduction with foul play suspected after the homicide of her sister, Frances Annette Cole, in 1983. Frances disappeared from their home on October 4, 1983. She was discovered deceased along U.S. 52 north of Lebanon on October 7, three days later. She had been raped before being shot in the back; the coroner determined that she died the same day she was found.

Beebout was considered a suspect in Frances's homicide and then became the prime suspect in Debra's 1981 disappearance. He died of a heart attack in April 1989, at age forty-nine.

Authorities matched semen and other fluid samples taken from Frances's remains to Beebout's DNA in early 1999. Investigators believe the evidence proves that Beebout was responsible for Frances's death; it is also theorized that he may have been involved in Debra's disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/debra-jean-cole,-86.473389,40.048643
Melinda Karen Creech,"September 5, 1979","Anderson, Indiana",13,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",110 lbs,"Melinda was placed in the Bronnenberg ChildrenÕs Home, an all-girls juvenile detention facility, on September 5, 1979 after she and another teenager were caught stealing motorcycles from a dealership. Two months later, the police went there to speak to Melinda in connection to another theft, but she was gone. It's unclear when and how she left the facility.

In 1994, Melinda's mother, Shirley Creech, told her other four children that a badly decomposed body found in New Jersey had been identified as Melinda. They believed her, although no funeral service was ever conducted for the child. When Shirley died in 2003, Melinda's siblings found letters among her personal effects which stated that dental records had proved that the New Jersey body was not Melinda's.

In 2004, police re-opened Melinda's missing persons case. They are currently tracking down and interviewing her old friends to see if any of them have heard from her. They do not know why Shirley lied to her family about Melinda's supposed death. Shirley had suffered from dementia for years prior to her passing, and perhaps she was simply confused. Melinda's siblings have described her as an extremely abusive parent.

There has been no activity on Melinda's Social Security number since 1979. Her father is now also deceased.

She may have reached out to her children via phone in approximately 1959. Her five children believe she would have never left them behind voluntarily.

Walcie had either a 1952 or 1954 Ford, cream and tan colored. Possibly purchased in Casa Grande, AZ.

Patricia Joan Chesher,"June 17, 1969","Albuquerque, New Mexico",12,Caucasian / White,"4'0""",86 lbs,"Patricia disappeared from Albuquerque, New Mexico at 3:00 p.m. on June 17, 1969. She left her home in the 800 block of San Pedro Drive southeast to sell raffle tickets for the Elks Club. She returned home briefly to pick up her coin purse which she'd forgotten, then left again, and never returned. She was last seen by a neighborhood girl who waved to her on the street.

Investigators initially assumed Patricia had run away from home, and she's still classified as a runaway with some agencies. Her family members never believed she left on her own, however. She's the youngest of eight children and was born in Indiana, and lived with her mother and some of her older siblings at the time of her disappearance.

The family's next-door neighbor is the only person known to have bought one of Patricia's raffle tickets, and she'd gotten her coin purse to make change for the dollar he'd given her. He's considered a person of interest in her case.

So is Patricia's uncle, her aunt's one-time husband, who canvassed the neighborhood looking for her after her disappearance. He'd previously been accused of molesting Patricia and some of her sisters.

Patricia's mother's boyfriend was at the Chesher home the day the child disappeared, but he said he was there at 3:30 p.m. and her family don't remember him being there until at least two hours after that. He never offered to look for Patricia. All three of these men are now deceased, and none of them have ever been named as suspects in her disappearance.

Patricia's sixteen-year-old sister broke up with her boyfriend shortly before the child went missing. Two days after Patricia vanished, he checked himself into a psychiatric hospital, saying he was upset over the breakup and Patricia's disappearance.

In 2010, authorities reopened the investigation and interviewed the boyfriend's relatives, who told them he'd confessed to the girl's murder. He suffers from severe mental illness and is in a hospital and unable to provide any useful information, and police weren't able to find anything to substantiate his alleged confession.

Patricia's family has never stopped looking for her. Her mother died in the 1980s, but her siblings are still alive and hope for resolution in her case.

Anthonette Christine Cayedito,"April 6, 1986","Gallup, New Mexico",9,Native American ; Caucasian / White,"4'7""",55 lbs,"Anthonette was last seen inside her family's residence in the 200 block of Arnold Street off Route 66 in Gallup, New Mexico on April 6, 1986. Her sister told authorities that Anthonette opened the front door after an unidentified male knocked sometime after 3:00 a.m. Her sister reported that the man claimed to be their Uncle Joe. Anthonette went to answer the door and her sister went back to sleep.

A neighbor reported seeing an older model brown truck with New Mexico license plates outside Anthonette's home between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m. that morning. The neighbor saw a man get out of the truck and walk towards Anthonette's house. The witness couldn't describe the man or the truck in detail, however.

Anthonette has never been heard from again. Her mother, who was asleep in the residence, didn't hear the knock on the door and didn't realize Anthonette was missing until approximately 7:00 a.m., when she went to wake up her children. She searched the neighborhood until 11:00 a.m. before notifying the police, but the police told her she would have to wait eight hours before making an official missing persons report.

Authorities questioned Anthonette's uncle regarding her disappearance, but he is not considered a suspect and was never thought to be involved in her abduction.

About a year after Anthonette disappeared, the Gallup Police Department got a phone call from someone who said she was Anthonette and she was in Albuquerque. Before they could trace the call, the police heard an angry-sounding male voice say, ""Who said you could use the phone?"" They heard the sound of a scuffle and a scream, then the line went dead.

The call lasted only forty seconds. Anthonette's mother listened to a recording of the call and believes the female voice was her daughter's.

Four years later, a waitress in Carson City, Nevada thought she saw Anthonette. She described as a girl in her early teens who was sitting with an ""unkempt"" couple. The girl kept dropping her fork and, each time the waitress picked it up for her, she squeezed the waitress's hand. After they all left, someone found a note under the girl's plate that read ""Help me! Call police."" It has not been confirmed that the girl in the restaurant was Anthonette.

Anthonette's case remains unsolved. She was a fourth-grader at Lincoln Elementary School at the time of her disappearance, and is described as mature and responsible for her age. Investigators believe foul play may have been involved in her disappearance and that she is deceased.

Tara Leigh Calico,"September 20, 1988","Belen, New Mexico",19,Caucasian / White,"5'7""
",120 lbs,"Calico left her house on Brugg Street in Belen, New Mexico to go on a bike ride at 9:30 on the morning of September 20, 1988. She took her mother's bicycle because her own bike had a flat tire. She was last seen riding her mother's neon pink Huffy mountain bike with yellow control cables and sidewalls on Highway 47 in Valencia County, at approximately 11:45 a.m. This location is approximately two miles from her home. She has never been seen again.

Calico biked the route daily during her routine 36-mile ride. Witnesses saw a dirty white or light gray-colored 1953 Ford pickup truck with a white handmade shell following Calico during her ride. It is not known if the truck is connected to her presumed abduction. She was apparently unaware of the truck's presence. Her mother's bicycle has never been located. A photo of it is posted with this case summary. Foul play is suspected in Calico's disappearance.

Calico is described as an efficient, independent person who liked to make lists scheduling her days. She enjoys running. On the day she vanished, she was concerned about staying on schedule and asked her mother, Patty Doel, to come get her if she was not home by 12:00 p.m.

Calico had plans to play tennis with her boyfriend at 12:30 p.m., and a class at 4:00 p.m. that day. She graduated from Belen High School and was enrolled as a sophomore at University of New Mexico at Valencia at the time of her disappearance. She had a high grade point average and planned to become a psychiatrist or psychologist. She also held a job at a local bank. When Calico vanished, she left behind her sneakers and equipment, school books, and purse.

Doel went to look for her at 12:05 p.m. the day she was last seen. When she could not find her along her usual bike route, she contacted police. The next day, Doel found a Boston cassette tape belonging to Calico by the side of the road. It was three miles from her home, and on opposite side of the highway, as if she had dropped it while riding away from her residence.

Later, part of Calico's Sony Walkman was recovered nineteen miles east of Highway 47 near the remote John F. Kennedy campground. Doel believed her daughter deliberately dropped those items to mark her trail. Near the cassette tape were some bike tracks and marks resembling a scuffle or skids.

Rumors have persisted for years that Calico was the unidentified female in a Polaroid photo discovered in Port St. Joe, Florida on June 15, 1989, nine months following her disappearance. A white Toyota cargo van had been parked in the spot prior to the discovery of the picture.

The photo was located on the ground in a convenience store's parking lot in St. Joe. It depicted a long-legged young woman and a smaller boy lying on some sheets and a blue striped pillow. Their mouths were covered with duct tape and their hands tied behind their backs. The photograph was taken in the back of a white Toyota cargo van with no windows, manufactured in the late 1980s.

Officials from Polaroid say the picture had to have been taken after May 1989; that type of film was not available until then. A copy of the V.C. Andrews novel My Sweet Audrina, a plastic cup, and a squirt gun are also visible in the photo. V. C. Andrews also happens to be Calico's favorite author. There is apparently a phone number written on the spine of the book, but some of the digits are unreadable. Experts say it could be 300 possible numbers, 57 of which are valid.

Authorities believe that the girl in the photo was seen walking along the beach in Port St. Joe shortly before the Polaroid was located. Witnesses said that the girl was accompanied by several unidentified adult Caucasian males who appeared to be giving her verbal orders. An unidentified boy was also pictured in the photo; both he and the girl were bound and gagged. The girl's photo and a computer-generated image of the boy are posted with this case summary.

Some people believed that the boy in the picture was Michael Henley, a nine-year-old boy who vanished in April 1988 from the same area of New Mexico as Calico. His mother identified the boy in the photograph as her son. Henley's remains were found in the Zuni Mountains in 1990.

The FBI examined the photo and cannot determine whether the girl is Calico or the boy was Henley. The girl's hairline and ear are similar to Calico's, and she has a mark on her calf similar to a scar Calico got from an car accident injury. It is not known whether the photo was staged or whether the boy and girl were being held against their will.

Two other similar photographs have surfaced over the years. One Polaroid, made on film that was unavailable until June 1989, was found near a residential construction site in Montecito, California and depicted a girl's face with her mouth covered by duct tape. The image was blurry, but Doel said she thought the girl in the photo was her daughter. She has a cowlick on her right temple like Calico, and also a lazy eye like Calico has. The blue-striped fabric the girl is lying on is similar to the pillow in the first photo.

The third Polaroid photograph was shot on film not available until February of 1990, and shows a woman loosely bound in gauze, wearing large black-framed eyeglasses, with her eyes covered in gauze. There is a man sitting next to her on the passenger seat of an Amtrak train. Doel wasn't sure whether the girl in the photo was her daughter; she believed this photograph may be a cruel joke.

Police have information that Calico was approached by two teenage boys on the day of her disappearance and they accidentally hit her with their truck while they were following her and harassing her. Investigators believe the boys took her away from the scene in their vehicle and that they panicked and killed her after she threatened to go to the police. Several other individuals may have been involved in covering up the crime.

This information has not been confirmed and no suspects have been publicly identified. Authorities believe Calico's body is probably in the same general area she went missing from.

Calico's mother and stepfather continued to live in the house where she'd lived until fifteen years after her disappearance, when they moved to Florida. Doel died in 2006, and Calico's biological father died in 2002. Her stepfather and siblings are still alive. Her case remains unsolved.

Sharon Baldeagle,"September 18, 1984","Eagle Butte, South Dakota",12,Native American,"5'3""",110 lbs,"Sharon ran away from her hometown of Eagle Butte, South Dakota on September 18, 1984, along with a fifteen-year-old friend named Sandi. The girls were hitchhiking together in Casper, Wyoming when they were picked up by a truck driver named Royal Russell Long.

Long took the two girls to his home in Evansville, Wyoming and fed them. Sandi stated he then offered them $100 for sexual services. When the girls refused, he tied them up at gunpoint, beat Sharon and raped Sandi. Sandi escaped and went for help, but by the time police arrived at the residence, Long and Sharon were gone.

A week later, Long was apprehended Albuquerque, New Mexico. Sharon wasn't with him and he said he did not know her whereabouts. When asked for his side of the story, Long said Sharon and Sandi had told them they were eighteen and nineteen, and that Sandi agreed to have sex with him for $100.

After the sex act took place, Sandi demanded $200 from him and threatened to accuse him of rape if he did not comply, and she and Sharon told him they were actually only fifteen and twelve years old. Long said there was a struggle, although he did not hit the girls, and his nose was bloodied. He threatened them with a pistol and tied them up.

He then took a nap, and when he woke up he discovered Sandi had escaped. He carried Sharon out to his truck and drove her to Cheyenne, then put her on a light-colored truck bound for Dallas, Texas and this was the last time he ever saw her. He said he didn't realize he was wanted for kidnapping and rape until he went back to Casper.

According to Long, after realizing the police were looking for him, he drove to Amarillo, Texas, trying to find Sharon or anyone who might have seen her. Authorities were unable to find anything to support his story; they couldn't identify the truck driver Sharon supposedly got a ride to Dallas with, or find anyone who had seen this trucker or his truck.

Prosecutors considered charging Long with Sharon's murder, but they decided against it, and Sharon's father stated he believed his daughter was alive. Long pleaded guilty to two counts of kidnapping for the purpose of committing indecent liberties with a minor, and was sentenced to two life terms in prison.

Long is also a possible suspect in the disappearances of Deborah Meyer and Carlene Brown, who vanished from Wyoming in 1974, and he is the prime suspect in the disappearances of Cinda Pallett and Charlotte Kinsey, who vanished from the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on September 26, 1981.

He was charged with kidnapping and murdering Cinda and Charlotte after his 1985 arrest, but the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. He died of a heart attack in prison in 1993. Sharon's father went to visit him shortly before his death, but Long refused to speak to him.

Sharon is the oldest of four siblings and had just begun her first year Brainerd Indian School in Hot Springs, South Dakota when she disappeared. Her father is still alive and searched for her all over the country after her disappearance, traveling as far as Arizona.

There were possible sightings of her in Wisconsin and Colorado in the years following her disappearance. She has never been found and foul play is suspected in her case.

An acquaintance, Charles E. Boothroyd, asked them to go on vacation to Utah that summer. Jeannette and Dennise agreed to join him, leaving the younger child at home with Jeannette's parents. The travelers were driving Boothroyd's olive-green 1960 Volkswagen.

On July 4, 1961, the trio met a man near Dead Horse Point, seventeen miles outside of Moab, Utah. He was heavyset, with black hair and a dark complexion. He spent two hours with them, telling them the history of the area while they took pictures. He drove away in a tan sedan without telling anyone his name. Boothroyd and the Sullivans planned to spend the night in Moab and it was getting dark, so they too left at this point.

Just a short distance down the road, around the bend, they saw the man they had spoken to pulled off to the side of the road, lying underneath his car. They stopped to ask if needed help and the man said he was having engine trouble and asked for a flashlight. When Boothroyd gave him the flashlight, the man threatened all three of them with a .22 caliber rifle and demanded money.

Boothryod laid his wallet on the road and Jeannette removed $250 from her purse, threw it on the ground and started to walk away, but the man shot her in the back of the head and shot Boothroyd twice in the face. Boothroyd survived his injuries, but Jeannette was killed almost instantly.

The shooter rolled her body into a nearby ravine and left Boothroyd lying on the ground. Dennise attempted to drive Boothroyd's car away, but the man chased her in his own vehicle, ran her off the road after half a mile, dragged her into his own car and drove away.

An oil worker at a rig two miles away heard the gunshots and the sound of the cars driving off and went to see what was wrong. He passed the abduction car speeding down the road and then the wrecked Volkswagen, then drove on and found Boothroyd still conscious by the roadside. Boothroyd told him what he'd seen and the oil worker called for assistance on his radio.

Two hours passed before an ambulance arrived to take the wounded man to the hospital, and law enforcement came shortly after that. They launched an extensive search of the area for any sign of Dennise or the kidnapper.

The prime suspect in the kidnap/homicide is Abel Benny Aragon, an unemployed coal miner who lived in Price, Utah. His vehicle matched the description of the abduction car. When the FBI stopped him for questioning on July 6, Aragon shot himself in the head with a .22 caliber pistol. He was rushed to the hospital, but died two hours later without regaining consciousness. Witnesses reported seeing him alone at 2:00 a.m. on July 5, about four and a half hours after the shooting at Dead Horse Point. He stopped a truck driver, gave him an envelope and asked him to mail it. The envelope contained money and a note addressed to Aragon's wife, telling her he loved her and their five children. It didn't mention any crimes.

Five hours after the shooting, Aragon arrived at a mining camp at Polar Mesa, where he had stayed several times before. When authorities searched the area on July 10, they found some of his clothing. Nearby, under a rock, they found the .22 rifle that had been used in the shooting, and hidden in the brush was a shovel identified as Aragon's.

Authorities determined from the paint scratches and other damage to his car that it was the same vehicle that rammed into Boothroyd's car and forced it off the road. They also found a set of Aragon's tracks, and a smaller set parallel to them, believed to be Dennise's. They never found any trace of Dennise herself, however.

Foul play is strongly suspected in Dennise's case due to the circumstances involved. An exhaustive search turned up no sign of her. Her body may be somewhere in the Polar Mesa area.","https://charleyproject.org/case/dennise-jeannette-sullivan

Nancy Wilcox,"October 2, 1974","Holladay, UT",16,White,"5'6""",120 lbs,"Nancy was last seen riding in a yellow Volkswagen Bug near her home on Arnett Drive in Holladay, Utah on October 2, 1974. She went out to buy a pack of gum and has never been heard from again. She was a student at Olympus High School and a cheerleader when she vanished, and active in her local Mormon church.

Authorities initially classified her as a runaway, but Nancy was only the first of many girls and young women to disappear from Utah during this time period. She was a junior at Olympus High School at the time of her disappearance, a cheerleader, and she had a job as a waitress. She left all her belongings behind, including her cherished jewelry.

Nancy is believed to have been a victim of the serial killer Ted Bundy. He was executed in Florida in 1989 and confessed to many murders before his death, including Nancy's. She fits the profile of his other victims and he was known to have been in the area at the time of her disappearance, and he drove a Volkswagen Bug similar to car she was seen riding in.

Bundy stated she was never in his car, however. He confessed that he abducted her at knifepoint, sexually assaulted her in a nearby orchard, and strangled her. He said he buried her body near Capitol Reef National Park, over two hundred miles from the site of her disappearance. It has never been found.

Bundy is also thought to be responsible for the murders of Nancy Baird, Ann Marie Burr, Lynette Culver, Julie Cunningham, Susan Curtis, Georgeann Hawkins, Vicki Hollar, Rita Jolly, Donna Manson, Denise Oliverson, and many other young women. The women continue to be listed as missing persons. Their remains have never been recovered.","https://charleyproject.org/case/nancy-wilcox

Susan Curtis,"June 27, 1975","Provo, UT",15,White,"5'7""",120 lbs,"Susan is from Bountiful, Utah. She was attending the Bountiful Orchard Youth Conference at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah when she disappeared on June 27, 1975. She'd ridden her bicycle fifty miles from Bountiful to Provo to attend the conference, which was lasted two days. Susan was last seen on the first day of the conference.

That evening, following a formal banquet at the Wilkinson Student Center, she left her friends to walk back to her dormitory and brush her teeth. The distance was about a quarter of a mile. Authorities don't believe Susan ever arrived at her dormitory, because when they checked her toothbrush it was dry.

A professor at the university may have seen Susan four days after she went missing, trying to sell a textbook in the back of his class. He identified her from a photograph and stated she was wearing a blue knit top and faded blue jeans at the time. Besides this alleged sighting, there has been no indication of Susan's whereabouts since the day she disappeared.

Susan was a student at Woods Cross High School at the time of her disappearance; she was on the track team and the girl's baseball team during her freshman year. She had a history of running away from home for days at a time, but she was never missing for very long.

The serial killer Ted Bundy confessed to Susan's murder before his 1989 execution. He stated he'd buried her body along a highway near Price, Utah, but a search of the site turned up no evidence. Susan has never been located, but it is believed she was one of his victims.

Other girls and young women who are still listed as missing persons but believed to be Bundy's victims include Nancy Baird, Ann Marie Burr, Lynette Culver, Julie Cunningham, Georgeann Hawkins, Vicki Hollar, Rita Jolly, Donna Manson, Denise Oliverson, and Nancy Wilcox.","https://charleyproject.org/case/susan-curtis

Nancy Perry Baird,04-Jul-75,"East Layton, Utah, USA",23,Caucasian,5'3,100 lbs,"Baird was last seen at the Fina gas station in the 200 block of south Highway 89 in East Layton, Utah on July 4, 1975. She was employed there as a service station attendant. A police officer on patrol saw her working alone there, and at 5:30 p.m., less than fifteen minutes later, she was discovered missing.

There was no evidence of robbery and no indications of a struggle, but about $10 worth of gasoline from the station's pumps had not been paid for. Baird's car was found locked and parked in the station lot where she'd left it, and her purse was inside the station, containing her medication and $167 in cash from from a recently cashed check.

Investigators questioned Baird's her ex-husband and two male friends, in her case. All of them had been out of state at the time she disappeared and passed polygraph examinations, so they were cleared of suspicion. Baird left behind a four-year-old son. It's considered unlikely that she would have left of her own free will. Just before her disappearance, witnesses saw a truck at the station; it was never identified and it's unclear whether it had anything to do with her case.

Authorities believe Baird was a victim of the serial killer Theodore Robert ""Ted"" Bundy, who was executed in Florida in 1989. A photo of Bundy is posted with this case summary. He was convicted of several murders and is suspected in scores more, including in the disappearances of Ann Marie Burr, Lynette Culver, Julie Cunningham, Susan Curtis, Georgeann Hawkins, Vicki Hollar, Rita Jolly, Donna Manson, Denise Oliverson and many other girls and young women. The women continue to be listed as missing persons. Their remains have never been recovered.

It should be noted, however, that Bundy never confessed to Baird's murder and in several ways her abduction doesn't fit the profile of his other crimes. Bundy never drove a truck, and Baird was the only possible victim of his that was abducted from a gas station. Baird's case remains open and unsolved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/nancy-perry-baird

Miller had just found out her ex-husband had died the previous year, and she was upset that no one had informed her earlier. She said she wanted to go visit his grave in the American Fork City Cemetery in American Fork, Utah. She has never been heard from again. She was reported missing on July 5.

Nearly three weeks after her disappearance, Miller's brown 1978 Honda Civic was found hidden near a sheep herder's camp on the back side of Mount Timpanogos, beyond the Timpooneke campground. One of the sheep herders told his boss the car belonged to a woman who got it stuck on a rough, rocky road. He stated the woman had lent him the car and he planned to drive to a Navajo Reservation in the Four Corners area.

When investigators questioned this man years later, he told them the woman had been wearing a red robe when she walked away from the car. However, Miller's red robe was found in the vehicle's backseat. Her purse, keys and wallet were also inside the vehicle. The sheep herder is considered a person of interest in her case. When he took a polygraph, the results were inconclusive.

Miller graduated from nursing school at Brigham Young University and worked as a registered nurse for twenty years. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, which remains unsolved.","https://charleyproject.org/case/mary-katherine-miller

Debra Lee Frost,"July 9, 1984","Salt Lake City, UT",17,White,"5'4""-5'6""",120 lbs,"Debra Frost disappeared at approximately 10:00 p.m. in her hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah on July 9, 1984. She was at the Mountain Bell Plaza, her boyfriend's place of work, at the time.

Debra told her boyfriend she planned to either walk or hitchhike home to the 1100 block of Montgomery Street; she never arrived. It is not known if she located a ride or began walking on her own.

Debra was a habitual hitchhiker in 1984. She had run away from home before, but she had always gone to stay at a friend's house; none of her friends saw or heard from her after her disappearance on July 9.

At the time of her disappearance, she was living with her boyfriend and his family. The following day, she was supposed to have traveled to California to to stay with relatives, in order to get away from unspecified problems in her life. Her brother believes she may have been involved with drugs.

In 2011, authorities learned Debra had contact with the police in Rock Springs, Wyoming on July 21, twelve days after she disappeared from Utah. The nature of this contact isn't known, however, since the police records have been purged. Rock Springs is about 200 miles from Salt Lake City.

Fred Martinez, a man Debra had dated occasionally, traveled between the two cities. He was 30 years old in 1984. Martinez died by suicide in 1995. Investigators haven't named him as a suspect in Debra's disappearance, but they are talking to people who knew him to see if there is any connection.

Debra has never been heard from again. Her father died in 2005 at age 58; the rest of her family continues to search for her. Her case remains unsolved.

Joyce Lynn Yost,"August 11, 1985","South Ogden, UT",39,White,"5'5""-5'7""",120-130 lbs,"Joyce Yost was last seen in South Ogden, Utah on August 10, 1985. She has never been heard from again. Her car was later found abandoned in the foothills east of town.

Yost disappeared two months after testifying against Douglas Anderson Lovell at his preliminary hearing. She had accused Lovell of kidnapping her in April 1985, taking her to his home in Clearfield, Utah, and raping her. Yost disappeared before his trial, but in December 1985 Lovell was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault based on her testimony from the preliminary hearing. He was sentenced to two terms of 15 years to life in prison.

He was long the prime suspect in Yost's disappearance, and investigators discovered that he'd twice hired friends from prison to murder her between the time of his arrest and the time of the preliminary hearing. (Lovell had met the men while he was serving a previous sentence for an armed robbery conviction. Neither of them actually tried to kill Yost.)

For years investigators lacked the evidence to charge him in her disappearance, until his wife agreed to wear a wire when she went to visit him in prison in 1991 and 1992. Lovell made incriminating statements about Yost's disappearance, saying he could get the death penalty for the crimes he had committed.

In 1993, on the day his murder trial was scheduled to begin, Lovell pleaded guilty to Yost's murder. He stated he broke into Yost's apartment while she was sleeping and threatened her with a knife. She pleaded for her life and promised to drop the sex assault case against him. He then drugged her with Valium, packed a suitcase of her belongings to make it look as if she'd left on her own, took her to a canyon outside of town and strangled her. He said he buried her body in a shallow grave in the Ogden Valley.

Prosecutors agreed not to seek a death sentence against Lovell if he would lead them to Yost's body. He was unable to find the exact spot where he'd buried her, however, in spite of a five-week search. He was sentenced to death in August 1993. He attempted to withdraw his guilty plea weeks later in a letter to the judge, claiming he had not been advised of his constitutional rights.

In September 2010, the Utah Supreme Court overturned his conviction and death sentence on those grounds. In April 2015, Lovell was convicted of murder at trial, sentenced to death again and returned to death row.

Lovell was questioned about his possible involvement in the disappearances of two other Utah women, Sheree Warren and Theresa Greaves. He maintained his innocence in those cases and cooperated with the investigations. He has not been linked to either of those cases. Greaves's remains were discovered in 2015; her death is under investigation. Warren has never been found.

Yost was declared legally dead in 1992. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2964dfut.html,-111.917896,41.179429
Sheree L. Warren,"October 2, 1985","Salt Lake City, UT",25,White,"5'4""-5'7""",110 lbs,"Sheree Warren was last seen at approximately 6:30 p.m. on October 2, 1985 in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was leaving the Utah State Employees Credit Union, where she was in management training, at the time. She and a coworker walked across the parking lot to their respective vehicles.

Warren never arrived home at her family's residence in Roy, Utah that evening and has not been seen again. Her car was discovered in the parking lot of the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 11, 1985, over one month after her initial disappearance. The vehicle appeared to have been parked at the location for some time prior to discovery. There was no trace of Warren at the scene.

Warren's boyfriend at the time of her 1985 disappearance, Cary Hartmann, a former reserve police officer, was later revealed to be a serial rapist and was imprisoned. At his 2005 parole hearing, he stated he was willing to cooperate with authorities regarding Warren's disappearance. Hartmann is still incarcerated and has never been connected to her case.

Douglas Lovell was questioned in Warren's disappearance in 1993, and in the 1983 disappearance of another Utah woman, Theresa Greaves. Lovell pleaded guilty to the 1985 murder of Joyce Yost, stating he had killed her to keep her from testifying against him in a rape case. Her body was never found.

He was sentenced to death, but his guilty plea was overturned on a technicality in 2010. He was convicted of murder at trial in April 2015 and sentenced to death a second time. Lovell maintains his innocence in Greaves and Warren's cases and was cooperative with investigators. Greaves's remains were discovered in 2015; her death is under investigation.

Rhonda Karren then went home to her Vernal, Utah residence. The coworker was the last person to see Rhonda, at approximately 10:30 pm. The next morning, Rhonda was scheduled to open up at the Kmart in Vernal. She never arrived. Her mother went to her home, and found it empty, with signs that something bad had happened. She called police and reported RhondaÕs disappearance that afternoon.

When police searched RhondaÕs home, they found evidence of a struggle. There were drag marks in the front yard, along with RhondaÕs shoes and jacket strewn about. Inside the house, they noticed that things were broken, and RhondaÕs purse and cigarettes were on the counter. Her mother had remarked that her daughter always kept her house spotless, and that she would never go anywhere without her cigarettes, not even to the bathroom. There was also reportedly some blood in the house.

Before Rhonda had gone missing, she was dealing with a nasty divorce from her third husband, Mark Karren. He was not living with her at the time, and quickly became a suspect in her disappearance. Unfortunately, he could not be connected, and the case fell silent. (I say this, as there is a period of time between 1987 and 2002 where, just, nothing happened apparently. No new significant evidence, and no news articles in that period of time.)

In 2002, authorities traveled to a location just across the Utah/Colorado border that Mark KarrenÕs relatives had been leasing at the time Rhonda disappeared. Apparently, he had been sighted in the area the night Rhonda vanished. Cadaver dogs located a scent at a well that had been buried since the late 80s. Property owners who were drilling the well the year after Rhonda disappeared had noticed that there was a foul smell, and upon bringing up the intake, noticed that there were long hairs matted to it.

She took her wallet with her when she disappeared, but left behind her vehicle.

Thomas Evan Trujillo, also known as Thomas Noffsinger, is considered a possible suspect in Hill's case. He and a co-defendant, Grant David Stensrud, were charged with murdering a man during a burglary in March 1990. After their arrests, one of Hill's prescription drug bottles was found in Trujillo's apartment. Her bloodstained purse was located in another apartment he rented, as was a woman's nightgown, underwear and jewelry.

Trujillo and Stensrud, who have prior criminal records, pleaded guilty to the 1990 murder. Trujillo is currently serving life in prison. He has never been charged in connection with Hill's case. He maintains his innocence in her disappearance and stated he didn't know her, and that he stole her purse from a car he burglarized.

Rosa Marie Camacho,"October 24, 1997","Hartford, Connecticut",4,Hispanic / Latina,"3'0""",38 lbs,"Rosa and her mother, Rosa Delgado, left their Hartford, Connecticut residence at approximately 5:00 p.m. to walk to a local store together and buy groceries, including milk and diapers. The store was in the 60 block of Madison Avenue. Delgado left her five-month-old daughter at her home in the care of a sister when she left with Rosa. She had only about $10.

A witness saw Rosa's father and Delgado's former boyfriend, Julio J. Camacho, speaking to them on a street corner in their Parkville area neighborhood prior to the females' disappearances. Rosa has never been seen again. Photos of both Julio and Delgado are posted with this case summary.

A woman's body was discovered floating in three feet of water in Columbia Lake in western New Jersey in November 1997, one month after Rosa and Delgado vanished. Her head and hands were missing. Authorities were initially unable to identify the homicide victim and named her ""The Lady Of The Lake.""

The woman's identity remained a mystery until DNA tests were conducted in 1999, nearly two years later. The tests proved that the remains were Delgado's.

There have been no arrests in either Rosa's disappearance or Delgado's homicide, but Julio has been named as the prime suspect. By 1997, he had been an officer with the Hartford Police Department for several years. He was still married when he began seeing Delgado in 1992; she was sixteen years old at the time.

Rosa was born in 1993 and Delgado applied for state benefits. As a result, the state of Connecticut sought child support from Camacho. He was ordered to pay nearly $200 a week to help support Delgado's daughter. He was already paying child support for three children by other relationships, while also raising his second wife's children.

In November 1997, Julio asked the court to cancel his child support order for Rosa until DNA testing established paternity. He didn't mention that Rosa and her mother were missing. Delgado and Rosa lived with relatives, who stated Julio visited them at their apartment and also called them regularly prior to their disappearances, but the visits stopped as soon as the pair vanished and he never contacted her family to see if they'd heard from them.

The police didn't publicize the disappearances until nearly a month had passed. Delgado's family accused the Hartford Police Department of mishandling the investigation and trying to cover up Julio's misconduct while he was with the department. He was charged with third-degree assault of his ex-wife in 1989 and terminated, but reinstated after the charge was dismissed.

Julio had seen two women, including Delgado, regularly while he was on duty and fathered children with both of them. Two women claimed Camacho had handcuffed, abducted and raped them while on duty and in uniform; one of the incidents occurred in 1995 and the other in 1997. Five others came forward with similar allegations. Julio was one of seven Hartford police officers accused of committing sex crimes while on duty during this period.

In 1998, Julio resigned from the Hartford Police Department, citing family issues as the reason. His wife, also a police officer, had been on extended medical leave. In 2001, Julio admitted to the 1995 and 1997 rapes and pleaded guilty, and the prosecution agreed to not seek charges in the other cases. He has been released from prison and now lives in Virginia.

Julio reportedly asked his brother to submit a false alibi for him after Rosa and Delgado disappeared. When authorities checked his car, they discovered the trunk liner was missing and the trunk bottom had been sanded down. They discovered a handmade hatchet, a wire garrote, two sawed-off shotguns inside Julio's residence during a search. There was no evidence of blood; the items were all very clean.

Jovanna Stacey Crawford,"June 5, 1981","Bridgeport, Connecticut",1,African American / Black,"2'5""",30 lbs,"Jovanna's mother's then-boyfriend, Ronald Garrett, was watching Jovanna in her family's residence in the P. T. Barnum Housing Project in the 80 block of Taylor Drive in Bridgeport, Connecticut on June 5, 1981. Jovanna's mother told him to bring Jovanna to her maternal great-grandmother, Mary Moales, who also lived in the housing project.

Garrett later stated that an unidentified boy arrived at the home at 10:20 a.m. and told Garrett that Moales had sent him to retrieve the child. He described the boy as about 10 or 11 years old, African-American, with small braids in his hair. He stated he thought he recognized the boy as a neighborhood child, and permitted him to take Jovanna. She has never been seen again.

Garrett was arrested for felony risk of injury to a minor on June 9, four days after Jovanna's disappearance, for giving her to the boy. He was convicted and sentenced to one year in prison.

Jovanna's grandparents and great-grandparents occasionally baby-sat her, but Moales never sent any person to pick her up that day in 1981. There is no evidence that the boy Garrett described even existed. He has never changed his story, however and maintains he had nothing to do with the young girl's disappearance.

Foul play is suspected in Jovanna's disappearance. She lived with her mother and brother in 1981. Her case remains unsolved.

Maria Florence Anjiras,"February 12, 1976","Norwalk, Connecticut",14,Caucasian,"5'6""",120 lbs,"Maria was last seen at her home on Milwood Road in Norwalk, Connecticut on February 12, 1976. She was supposed to go to a vocal lesson in the afternoon, then babysit a neighbor's child that evening. Her father saw her at 2:15 p.m., while he was leaving for work.

Maria did not go to her lesson or her 5:00 p.m. babysitting job. After her disappearance, her blue English Racer bicycle was found abandoned near St. Mary's Lane, approximately one mile from her residence. The bike was found at the home of one of Maria's friends, but the girl said she hadn't seen or heard from her. There was no sign of her at the scene and she never returned home.

Maria's parents stated she was behaving normally on the day of her disappearance. She had threatened to run away two weeks before, but her father talked her out of it. She reportedly took some money, pajamas, a pair of jeans and several sweaters from her home when she went missing, indicating she left of her own accord.

There were several reported sightings of her around Norwalk in the days and weeks after her disappearance; many of the witnesses were people who knew her. She was reportedly seen at the Duchess Restaurant on Main Street and possibly in an orange car and a black car in the same vicinity.

In August 1976, a fifteen-year-old classmate saw Maria at a bar on Westport Avenue and told her she should go home. Maria started crying and said, ""I know."" She was accompanied by a man who was a member of the Charter Oaks Motorcycle Club. Police identified the biker and traced him to the town of Bethel, Connecticut.

It was thought that Maria was sighted at the Charter Oaks clubhouse on August 13, but in 2015 authorities identified the girl they'd thought was Maria, and it was a different person, a 17-year-old girl from Danbury, Connecticut.

Maria apparently ran away when she left her home in 1976, but it would be highly unusual for her to not contact her family for so long, and there is suspicion that she was a crime victim. There is no hard evidence that foul play was involved in her disappearance, however.

Maria was a freshman at Norwalk High School in 1976. Her friends described her as an artistically talented teenager who took ballet lessons and drama classes was was involved in her school theater group. Both of Maria's parents died in the early 1980s, but her brother and sister are still alive and hope she may be found. Her case remains unsolved.

Patricia Ann Adkins,"June 29, 2001","Marysville, Ohio",29,White/Caucasian,"5'8""",120 lbs,"Adkins was last seen departing her place of work at the Honda of America automotive plant in Marysville, Ohio. She clocked out a few seconds after midnight on June 29, 2001, at the end of the second shift.

She had worked for the plant for nearly ten years and had become a supervisor at the assembly line, and she was anticipating a promotion when she disappeared. The plant closed down that night for a week because of the Fourth of July. She has never been heard from again.

Adkins had been having an affair with a married co-worker at the time of her disappearance; they'd dated periodically for years. His name has not been released to the public. She told her loved ones and acquaintances about the relationship and said the man planned to leave his wife to be with her.

She gave him approximately $90,000 over several years, depleting her savings accounts and borrowing against her 401k retirement fund. The money was supposed to be so the boyfriend could buy out his share of his and his wife's jointly owned business when he divorced her to be with Adkins. Shortly before she went missing, Adkins told her boyfriend she would need to start repaying the 401k loans soon.

Just before her disappearance, Adkins told her family and friends she was going on a vacation to Canada with her boyfriend. She put her pets in a kennel and asked her sister to look after her seven-year-old daughter while she was gone. She said her boyfriend had told her they were going to a cabin in a remote area without phone service, so she wouldn't be able to call her family. He also told her not to pack anything because they would buy whatever she needed once they arrived there.

Adkins asked a female friend to drive her to work the night she disappeared so she could leave with her boyfriend to start their vacation. She told her friend that her boyfriend had to give a male coworker a ride home and had told her to hide in the bed of his pickup truck until he dropped the other man off.

In spite of her boyfriend's instructions not to take anything, Adkins had packed a small teal-colored duffel bag. She told her friend it contained something she'd bought at Victoria's Secret and that the item was blue. The bag and its contents have never been found.

Adkins was scheduled to see her hairdresser after her vacation was over; she never kept the appointment. She was reported missing by her sister on July 8, after she failed come home and pick up her daughter. She left her car behind in her garage and all her belongings undisturbed inside her house.

When her boyfriend was questioned, he said he and Adkins had no plans to go on vacation together, he had never had an affair with her and he only knew her slightly. He and his friend said they left the plant together on June 29, drove 30 miles in the direction of their hometown of Canton, Ohio, stopped at a Burger King restaurant, waited 45 minutes in the drive-through line, got their food and went home.

The boyfriend's wife backed up their story, saying her husband arrived home at 2:30 a.m., the usual time, and that she didn't know anything about an affair. The Burger King manager, however, said they were never busy in the early hours of the morning and no one would have had to wait 45 minutes in the drive-through to get their food.

Adkins's boyfriend gave the police permission to search his home and they found a new truck bed cover in his garage. The boyfriend had bought it on June 26 and he said he used it to cover some fishing gear in his truck bed; he put it on the truck on the morning of June 29 and removed it on July 8. He normally didn't drive the truck much, but he drove it to work the night Adkins disappeared.

Police took the cover for analysis and found cat hairs on it and a small spot of blood. Adkins's veterinarian determined the hair came from her cats, but authorities haven't been able to test the blood for DNA because the spot is too small. Police also found some items at the boyfriend's residence that Adkins told people she had given him, which contradicted his story that they barely knew each other.

The boyfriend took a polygraph test about the case and failed it. Shortly after Adkins disappeared, he quit his job at the Honda plant and never returned to work there.

Adkins was declared legally dead in 2006. There's been no activity on her financial accounts since she went missing. Her loved ones stated she was happy with her life and her job, and maintained a good working relationship with her ex-husband. Both authorities and her family believe she was the victim of homicide. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/patricia-ann-adkins,-83.367143,40.236449

She was at Chris's Place, a bar on Clark Street, at the time of her disappearance. Aldrich left the bar at 2:00 a.m., near closing time, and walked east on Clark Street towards Concord Avenue. She has never been heard from again.

The same night Aldrich disappeared, her purse was found on her mother's doorstep with her medicine inside it. Her mother took them inside, not realizing there was a problem. Aldrich's brother reported her missing several days later when he dropped by their mother's house and found out she'd never returned to pick up her belongings.

Prior to her disappearance, Aldrich kept in regular touch with her brother's wife, speaking to her three to five times a week. She would always tell her family members whenever she went anywhere. After late March 1997, she never contacted her loved ones again.

Foul play is suspected in Aldrich's disappearance; she hasn't used her credit cards, Social Security number or driver's license since 1997. Her brother stated she liked to sing and enjoyed going to karaoke nights at bars. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.

May have been wearing t-shirt, blue or black pants, zip-up hooded sweatshirt.Êsneakers.

Cynthia Jane Anderson,"August 4, 1981","Toledo, Ohio",20,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",115 lbs,"Anderson was employed as a legal secretary at the law offices of James Rabbit and Jay Feldstein on east Manhattan Boulevard in Toledo, Ohio in 1981. She was last seen at the business on August 4 of that year.

Her employers discovered that the radio was turned on and their desks were prepared for the day upon their arrival at work. Unclaimed mail had been placed inside the front door handle and a romance novel Anderson was reading was opened on her desk. There was no sign of her elsewhere in the building.

Her purse and car keys were missing, but her vehicle was locked in the parking lot outside of the office. She didn't leave a note on the door, which was her usual habit whenever she had to step out of the office during work hours. Anderson has never been seen again. She left a substantial amount of money behind in her bank account, and her Social Security number has not been used since her disappearance.

Anderson had received suspicious phone calls at work in the weeks prior to her disappearance which seemed to disturb her. Her family reported that she also suffered from recurring nightmares about being attacked by a man. Anderson's employers installed an emergency buzzer at her desk during the summer of 1981. She also kept the office's doors locked at all times. This was due to the harrassing calls and ominous messages.

There have been several suspects in Anderson's disappearance, none of which have been officially ruled out in her case by investigators. Anthony and Nathaniel Cook, two brothers convicted of nine murders in the Ohio area between them in the 1980s, have denied any involvement in Anderson's case.

Another convicted murderer currently imprisoned in Ohio is thought to have possibly been involved in her disappearance as well, though any connection has never been established and the man has never been publicly identified.

Convicted drug dealer Jose Rodriguez Jr. and his attorney, Richard Neller, are also suspects in Anderson's case. Neller worked with Anderson's law firm during 1981 and authorities theorize that she may have overheard conversations between Neller and Rodriguez concerning drug deals prior to her disappearance. Investigators believe the information may have led to Anderson's possible abduction and/or murder, though this has never been proven.

An informant testified at Rodriguez's trial in 1995 that Rodriguez confessed to killing Anderson, but the testimony was ruled to be unreliable. Both Rodriguez and Neller are currently imprisoned due to drug convictions. No one has been charged in connection with Anderson's disappearance.

Anderson is described as a devout Christian fundamentalist who enjoyed her job and family life in 1981. She had a boyfriend and many friends. Anderson was planning to quit her secretarial job two weeks after her disappearance in order to attend Bible college. Her family has stated it would be extremely uncharacteristic of her to vanish without explanation for her loved ones.

Anderson's parents are both deceased; her mother died of cancer in 1983 and her father died in 2008. In her father's obituary, it was noted that Anderson preceded him in death. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/cynthia-jane-anderson,-83.515507,41.687564

Erica Nicole Baker,"February 7, 1999","Kettering, Ohio",9,Caucasian / White,"3'10"" - 3'11""
",95 lbs,"Erica's parents are divorced and she spent most of February 7, 1999 with her father, Greg Baker, in their hometown of Kettering, Ohio. Erica was apparently upset that Greg had forgotten to purchase tickets to an upcoming father/daughter dance, but her father said she settled down shortly thereafter. Greg dropped Erica off at the home she shared with her mother, Melissa ""Misty"" Baker, at approximately 3:00 p.m. Photos of Greg and Misty are posted with this case summary.

Erica received permission from Misty to take her aunt's Shih Tzu dog for a walk in Indian Riffle Park, which was close to her family's residence. Erica left the house sometime between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m. Two witnesses saw her sitting on a bench with the dog near the park's pond shortly after 4:00 p.m. She has never been seen again.

The dog, dragging its blue leash, ran unaccompanied to the witnesses sometime after Erica was last seen. They called Animal Control to pick up the dog, but didn't realize the girl they had seen earlier was Erica until news reports of her disappearance surfaced later that night.

Misty became concerned when Erica failed to return home later in the evening and summoned the authorities. An extensive search of the area produced no clues as to Erica's whereabouts. A pink Winnie The Pooh sweatshirt was discovered on a road in Germantown, Ohio several days after Erica disappeared. Bloodhounds reacted positively to Erica's scent on the clothing, but her family said the shirt did not belong to her.

Investigators would like to identify and question a two possible witnesses who were seen in the area around the same time Erica was last seen. The first is a Caucasian female jogger, who was wearing a white turtleneck, black stretch pants and white sneakers. The other is a middle-aged white man who was wearing a black raincoat and walking a long-haired spaniel type dog.

Greg and Misty passed polygraph tests and are not suspects in their daughter's case. Authorities said that they identified four possible suspects in January 2000, five months after Erica was last seen. None of the suspects have been charged due to a lack of evidence. According to investigators, several of the men have histories of child molestation.

The police got leads that Erica was struck by a vehicle and killed the day of her disappearance and the occupants of the car panicked and disposed of her body. The tips named Jan Marie Franks, a drug addict, as the driver. She died in 2001. Her lawyer, Beth Lewis, has refused to tell the police what, if anything, Franks told her about Erica's case, citing attorney-client confidentiality. Ohio law states that a dead person's spouse can waive attorney-client confidentiality for them, and Franks's husband did so. However, Lewis has disputed Franks's husband's authority to waive confidentiality and continued to refuse to answer questions, in spite of being held in contempt of court and jailed.

In February 2004, just three days before the statute of limitations on the offenses would have expired, Christian John Gabriel was indicted for evidence tampering and gross abuse of a corpse in connection with Erica's case. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. Gabriel was Franks's boyfriend. The grand jury had the option of indicting him for a range of offenses such as aggravated murder and vehicular homicide, but declined to do so. They also refused to indict another suspect, Clifford Butts.

Prosecutors stated they believed Gabriel was driving a van which struck and killed Erica on Glengerry Drive near the Kettering Recreation Center, and he buried her body in Caesar Creek State Park to cover up the crime. Gabriel confessed the crime to police and stated that he and Franks were in the van together and they were under the influence of drugs and alcohol and had been shoplifting in the area the day Erica was killed. He lead authorities to various places where he said he had buried the child's body, but nothing was discovered in any of the locations and investigators stated they were not going to search again for Erica's remains unless they found more evidence indicating where she was.

Gabriel pleaded not guilty to the charges and maintains his innocence in Erica's disappearance; he stated his confession was completely untrue and he only made the statements because he was being pressured by authorities. He was nevertheless convicted in October 2005 and sentenced to the maximum term of six years in prison. He was released from custody in June 2011.

",130 lbs,"Stacey Balas was last seen at approximately 1:00 a.m. on November 26, 1996 in her hometown of Fairview Park, Ohio. She was employed at the Subway restaurant on west 220th Street and Lorain Road. Balas was locking the building for the night with the restaurant's manager at the time she was last seen. She never returned to her residence in North Ridgeville, Ohio that evening and has not been heard from again.

Balas was scheduled to work at 11:30 a.m. later in the day, but never arrived for her shift. Her blue 1995 Nissan Pathfinder SUV was discovered abandoned in the parking lot of the Cleveland Motel on Lorain Road at approximately 4:00 p.m. that day. The motel is located three blocks from the Subway restaurant. There was no sign of Balas at the scene, but her purse was inside the SUV.

Balas's credit card was used three times after she was reported missing: in Brooklyn, Ohio on November 26, in Brooklyn on November 28 and in Cleveland, Ohio on November 29. All of the charges were small ones, totaling less than $35. Her boyfriend was ruled out as a suspect in her case.

Balas received a substantial insurance settlement after her car accident in 1988 and authorities looked into the possibility that someone had tried to take advantage of her and this caused her disappearance, but they found no evidence to support that theory.

In November 2005, Balas's manager at Subway, Larry Wade, confessed to her murder. He had been the prime suspect in her case from the beginning and was convicted of raping another Ohio woman three months after Balas vanished.

Wade was charged with aggravated murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping in connection with Balas's disappearance. He stated he had strangled her in the Subway's kitchen after she rebuffed his sexual advances, and afterwards he dumped her body in a trash bin. Wade initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, but in May 2006 he pleaded guilty to Balas's murder and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.

Ruth Elizabeth Baumgardner,"May 4, 1937","Delaware, Ohio",22,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",110 lbs,"Baumgardner was a senior art major at Ohio Wesleyan University in 1937. She belonged to the Delta Delta Delta (or ""Tri-Delt"") sorority and lived alone in room 319 in Austin Hall on the Ohio Wesleyan campus. She resided with her parents in the 2000 block of Arthur Avenue in Lakewood, Ohio when she was not at college.

On the evening of her disappearance, Baumgardner practiced for a singing competition, then studied in her dormitory for a test which was scheduled the following day. Her sorority sisters last saw her shortly after 11:00 p.m. on May 4, 1937. She had her hair up in curlers and pins and was behaving normally at the time. Sometime before midnight she said goodbye to her friends. She has never been seen or heard from again.

The Tri-Delts alerted campus authorities about Baumgardner's disappearance at 10:30 p.m. the following day, when they realized she hadn't attended any of her classes. Subsequent investigation revealed that someone, probably Baumgardner herself, had left her dormitory room key on the back corner of an Austin Hall staircase between the second and third floors. Her new red Dodge was found parked undisturbed in its regular garage; the key was in the ignition.

Baumgardner's room was in perfect order, which is uncharacteristic of her. Her bed did not appear to have been slept in, her hair pins had been put away, and her pajamas and robe were hanging in the closet. The alarm clock had been set for 6:00 a.m. and had run down, indicating that she got up at that time on May 5 and left Austin Hall without being seen. She is believed to have been carrying an old handbag at the time, and probably no more then $5 in cash. Baumgardner's watch, sorority pin and some loose change were left behind in her room.

Initially it was believed that Baumgardner had suffered an amnesiac episode and wandered away from campus. The theory was bolstered by several reported sightings of her in the Delaware area in the days following her disappearance. None of the sightings were confirmed, however.

At the time she went missing, Baumgardner was worried about whether she would get enough credit hours to graduate on schedule, and in the last letter she wrote to her parents she stated that she had many things to and did not know how she was going to do them all, and she was ""very, very tired."" However, she was never located, which is unusual in cases of amnesiac disappearances.

Authorities investigated the possibility that Baumgardner left of her own accord, possibly with a boyfriend, since several of the reported sightings placed her with a young man. However, Baumgardner was happily engaged to her boyfriend in Lakewood and her friends did not believe she was seeing anyone else. There is also no evidence of foul play in her case, although a local resident living near the Ohio Wesleyan campus reported hearing screams between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. on May 5.

Little evidence is available in Baumgardner's case. Her disappearance is no longer being investigated by police due to the passage of time, but her case remains a mystery.",http://charleyproject.org/case/ruth-elizabeth-baumgardner,-83.067927,40.295976

Her loved ones stated she appeared to be in a bad mood and was exhibiting ""unstable behavior.""

Susan Diane Wolff Cappel,"March 16, 1982","Newcomerstown, Ohio",19,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",107 lbs,"Susan was last seen at Thompson's IGA supermarket in her hometown of Newcomerstown, Ohio on March 16, 1982. She had just gotten off her shift at work there and was walking toward her parents' car in the parking lot when an older model blue car pulled up. A co-worker saw Susan speak to the driver, a man, then get in the passenger side of the car. She has never been heard from again.

A county grand jury's investigation records into Susan's case were misplaced sometime during the proceeding years. The documents have not been located. Susan's parents have never given up the search for her. They suspect that her ex-husband, Allen Cappel, who was employed with the Ohio Department of Transportation, was involved in her disappearance.

Allen died in a car accident in September 2003, twenty-one years after Susan's disappearance. He had always maintained his innocence in Susan's case and stated he believed she left town voluntarily. Susan and Allen were high school sweethearts who married in her senior year and had an eighteen-month-old son, Damin Cappel, in 1980. Susan left him behind when she vanished.

Allen and Susan were in the process of a divorce and fighting over custody of Damin when Susan went missing Allen was granted the divorce in 1983, a year after Susan vanished, and got custody of Damin. He remarried five months later.

Susan's parents stated at the time of her disappearance, Susan was hoping to get custody of Damin and was refurbishing her old room at her parents' home for that purpose. She had been hoping to spend March 17, the day after her disappearance, with Damin. The custody hearing was scheduled for three weeks after Susan went missing.

Allen had friends, Patrick ""Rick"" and his cousin Robert ""Kelly"" Parrish, whom Susan's parents suspect were involved in her disappearance. Rick owned an older model blue Plymouth Satellite similar to the car Susan was seen getting into the day of her disappearance. Two weeks after Susan's disappearance, Rick, Kelly, and another individual were killed inside that vehicle in a single-car crash.

Susan's parents speculate that Susan got into the car with them and they threatened Damin's life, so she agreed to disappear and drop her custody plea for him to keep him safe.

In 1983, a Greyhound bus driver believed he saw Susan. He said the woman had purchased a ticket from Reno, Nevada to Newcomerstown and the driver picked her up in Cleveland. The woman who resembled Susan carried only a satchel and asked to be let off at a filling station in Newcomerstown instead of the bus stop.

The driver refused and stopped the bus at the bus stop, where the woman got out and ran in the direction of the filling station. Rick Parrish worked at that filling station at the time of Susan's disappearance. The driver reported his sighting to police immediately, but an extensive search of the area turned up no signs of Susan.

Susan's case remains unsolved. The investigation into her disappearance was reopened in 2006. Foul play is suspected in her case.",http://charleyproject.org/case/susan-diane-wolff-cappel,-81.603165,40.272603
Tammi Jean Campbell,"June 12, 1999","Grove City, Ohio",33,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",100 lbs,"Campbell was last seen on June 12, 1999 when she dropped her twelve-year-old son off at the home of a friend, Sharon Hager, in Grove City, Ohio. She was going to go visit another friend that night, then work the next day at CVS Pharmacy.

Campbell never arrived at work, which is uncharacteristic of her. She was supposed to meet a drug dealer at 3:00 a.m. to make a purchase, but she never showed up there either. She has never been heard from again.

Hager became concerned about her and went to her apartment in the 3100 block of Southwest Boulevard the day after she was last seen. She found Campbell's ex-boyfriend, Gary Lee Robinson, there; he had been staying at the apartment for about a month.

A photograph of Robinson is posted with this case summary. He had allegedly been abusive towards Campbell and she moved to Grove City from Kentucky in 1998 to get away from him.

Robinson moved to Grove City in 1999 and Campbell let him stay with her. She was being evicted from her apartment and invited Robinson to join her in Columbus, Ohio, but then she told him their romance was over. When Hager asked Campbell's whereabouts, he suggested Campbell was out using drugs.

Her keys, identification, purse and wallet were in the apartment, her car was across the street in the Dairy Queen parking lot, and there were no indications of foul play. Robinson didn't report her missing. Hager attempted to file a missing persons report three days later, but wasn't allowed to. She finally was permitted to file a report on June 18.

After Campbell's disappearance, Robinson was sentenced to four years in prison for domestic violence and felonious assault in a case involving his stepdaughter. Police searched Robinson's property after Campbell's disappearance and found a blue shirt and some of Campbell's jewelry, including a gold and diamond necklace which her son says she never removed. The necklace was buried in the backyard of Robinson's parents' home.

Robinson was indicted for Campbell's murder in May 2009. At his trial in April 2010, his ex-girlfriend testified against him, as did Campbell's son. Neighbors reported hearing a loud thumping sound coming from Campbell's apartment at 3:30 a.m. the night of her disappearance. Robinson's ex-girlfriend stated he'd told her he choked Campbell to death inside their apartment, wrapped her body in carpet and disposed of it in a local landfill.

Robinson's attorney stated there was no evidence that Campbell was a homicide victim, and suggested her drug use may have been a factor in her death or one of her other boyfriends killed her, if she was in fact murdered at all. Robinson was convicted of murder and evidence tampering in April 2010, after a four-day trial.

Campbell is originally from Texas. She had reportedly been an exotic dancer prior to her disappearance and may have lived on the streets. She was adopted and her adoptive parents are dead, and she has no other known relatives besides her son. Since her disappearance, there's been no evidence of her in the Social Security database and other national databases.

Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/tammi-jean-campbell,-83.084725,39.890376

Linda Bowdre,"February 14, 1988","Springfield Township, Ohio",39,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",140 lbs,"Linda resided in the 10100 block of Hamilton Avenue in the New Burlington area of Springfield Township, Ohio in 1998. She was employed as an executive at AT&T in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was last seen on February 14, 1988.

She had breakfast at a restaurant that morning with Larry Bowdre, her husband of eighteen years, then they returned home. Larry tated he left home at 3:30 p.m. to take care of personal business and when he returned 45 minutes later, his wife was missing. She was reported missing after she failed to arrive for work the day after her disappearance. An extensive search of the area produced no clues as to Linda's whereabouts.

She left behind her pets, her gold 1988 Acura Legend, her antique jewelry and all her clothing. Her purse disappeared with her, but about a week later it was found in a mailbox at a post office on Dalton Street in Cincinnati. Inside were her credit cards and other personal items.

At the time of her disappearance, Linda had been having an affair with a married coworker and she had scheduled an appointment with a divorce lawyer. Larry was aware of the affair and that Linda planned to leave him as soon as her boyfriend got a divorce.

He gave police a printout of a letter he had written to Linda's boyfriend's wife, asking her to help him convince Linda to change her mind about leaving him; he wrote that he loved her very much about had forgiven her infidelity. It's unclear whether Larry actually sent this letter to Linda's boyfriend's wife. He had, however, sent an letter to Linda's boyfriend threatening to throw a jar of burning gasoline through his bedroom window if he didn't end the affair.

When authorities first interviewed Larry at the couple's home after Linda's disappearance, they noted there was a strong smell of chlorine bleach and several windows were open. They later confiscated two kitchen cupboards with possible bloodstains on them a muddy shovel. Larry has been uncooperative in the investigation and hired an attorney after being questioned by police. He maintains his innocence in Linda's case, and suggested she had simply ""run off"" with her boyfriend.

In 1989, Linda's mother, Joan McCurdy, sued Larry over Linda's disappearance. The complaint stated Larry had caused McCurdy ""severe emotional distress"" when he failed to notify her that Linda was missing; she didn't find out until the police contacted her several days after Linda was last seen. McCurdy also demanded that Larry return $10,000 worth of antique furniture she had lent Linda. She said she had repeatedly asked for the return of the items and Larry had ignored her. The outcome of the lawsuit is unknown.

Linda grew up in Michigan and is a 1970 graduate of Michigan State University. She met Larry in college; he was a teaching assistant in one of her classes. They initially lived in Lansing, Michigan, until Linda's job transferred her to Cincinnati in 2016. She was the primary breadwinner in the family. They both enjoyed gardening together and had a large garden at their home.

Authorities have suspected that foul play was involved in her case since the beginning of the investigation; her disappearance is classified as a homicide. It remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/linda-bowdre,-84.5522475,39.2539137
Brenda Lee Borowski,"August 15, 1995","Swanton, Ohio",35,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",125 lbs,"Borowski was left her home in the Swanton Meadows mobile home park in Swanton, Ohio sometime between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. on August 15, 1995. She was en route to work; she was a drapery salesperson at the Elder-Beerman department store. Borowski's two teenage children were asleep when she left. They notified police when she didn't return by mid-evening.

The last sighting of Borowski was at 10:00 a.m., when she withdrew money from an ATM in Toledo, Ohio. She was accompanied by her ex-boyfriend, John Thomas Noser, at the time. They had lived together for a year and broke up two months before her disappearance. Borowski has never been heard from again.

Noser was arrested two days later, in the remote wooded campsite where he was living in Middletown, Ohio. He had been driving Borowski's 1983 Pontiac, and its steering column had been peeled open. Police later searched the nearby woods and found some of Borowski's clothing, makeup and jewelry; the items had been burned recently.

Noser was charged with auto theft, but the charge was dropped because he claimed Borowski had loaned him the vehicle and no one could prove she hadn't. He said Borowski had been shot to death during a botched drug deal and her body was dumped near a landfill in north Toledo. A search of the landfill turned up no clues, however.

In 1999, Noser was charged with Borowski's murder. Investigators believe jealousy was the motive; Noser didn't want Borowski to start dating anyone else. He was convicted in 2000 and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

Dunn was raised by adoptive parents in Oregon. She became involved with drugs and prostitution in her mid-teens and worked as a prostitute in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington until the 1980s, when she and her pimp relocated to New York City.

Dunn became pregnant, moved back to Oregon, left her daughter with her parents and moved to Alaska for a fresh start. She enrolled in a cosmetology school in Anchorage, but soon returned to prostitution and drugs. She had another daughter and, unable to stay clean, lost custody of her.

She has never been heard from again.

Investigators believe the serial killer Robert Hansen may have been involved in Easland's case, as well as in the disappearances of Megan Emerick, Mary Thill and Andrea Altiery. In 1984, he confessed to 17 murders and 30 rapes over the previous twelve years, and acknowledged Easland was one of his victims. He lead authorities to the grave sites, but only twelve bodies were recovered.

Clarissa Ann Culberson,"August 28, 1996","Blanchester, Ohio",22,Caucasian / White,"5'2"" - 5'3""",122 lbs,"Culberson dated Vincent ""Vince"" Doan from 1994 to 1996 in their hometown of Blanchester, Ohio. A photos of Doan is posted with this case summary. Their relationship was extremely volatile and abusive. Culberson informed authorities that Doan smashed her car's windows while she sat inside the vehicle and also hit her in the lower abdomen, bruising her kidneys, in 1995 and again in 1996.

Culberson filed a criminal complaint of misdemeanor assault against Doan during the summer of 1996 after he allegedly hit her on the head with a space heater, requiring Culberson to receive five surgical staples to close the wound. Culberson and Doan were scheduled to appear at a court hearing in early September 1996 regarding the complaint.

Culberson's family told authorities that Doan abducted her and held her at gunpoint for five hours in on August 25, three days before she was last seen, before she convinced him to drive her home. They also stated that Doan was obsessed with Culberson and was very controlling.

Culberson was last seen at approximately 11:30 p.m. on August 28, 1996. She was dropped off at her residence after attending a volleyball game with two friends. One of her neighbors say she left the house in her car a few minutes after arriving.

Culberson has never been heard from again and her red 1989 Honda CRX disappeared with her. She was missed at 6:00 a.m. the next morning when her mother noticed that her car was not in the driveway. Photographs of a similar vehicle and Culberson's car license plate, which was numbered ROL402, are posted with this case summary.

Doan had appeared at the volleyball game the night Culberson disappeared, angry with her because she would not accompany him to court where he had to appear on a traffic violation. He wanted to drive her home, but Culberson attempted to avoid being alone with him.

She was seen shaking her head ""no"" to Doan numerous times, and told him she was the designated driver and had to see her friends home. Doan finally left the bar angrily and those inside could hear his tires squealing as he peeled out of the parking lot.

Culberson's loved ones believe that she may have driven to Doan's house during the early morning hours of August 29, after her friends dropped her off at home.

Doan at first claimed he hadn't seen her, but later changed his story and said that Culberson arrived at his home at 12:30 a.m. and honked, but he refused to speak to her. He told authorities that she appeared to be intoxicated at the time of the alleged incident, but Culberson's friends say she had only one beer while she was with them and was not drunk.

Doan changed his story a third time and says Culberson went to his house and he came out wrapped in a towel and told her he no longer loved her, and she sped away in her car. He was immediately considered the prime suspect in Culberson's disappearance, in part because of the many conflicting accounts he gave to investigators about the time he last saw her.

Authorities began searching Doan's family's property in Blanchester five days following Culberson's disappearance. The former police chief, Richard Payton, was a friend of Doan's family and allegedly warned them that he was bound to become a prime suspect in Culberson's case.

Payton allowed the Doan family's property to be left unattended overnight during the search for evidence. Footprints were discovered on the floor of a drained pond on the property the following morning. It is believed that Doan and possibly several of his relatives removed Culberson's body from the pond during the evening hours when the site was not secured.

Doan was charged and tried for Culberson's kidnapping and murder in 1997. He was originally charged with kidnapping only, but two counts of aggravated murder, reflecting two separate police theories of the killing, were added to the indictment five days before Doan was to go to trial. The trial had to be postponed over one month as a result.

Doan maintained his innocence throughout the trial and attempted to stage an appeal, but his request was denied. He refused to answer prosecutors' questions regarding the whereabouts of Culberson's remains and utilized his Fifth Amendment rights during the proceedings.

The prosecution presented evidence that Doan was a very violent, controlling man whose abuse on Culberson had escalated into murder. One of Doan's neighbors testified that she had seen him assaulting Culberson in his front yard on the morning of her disappearance.

The ex-wife of Doan's half-brother Tracey Baker said he appeared at the house she and Tracey shared at 3:15 a.m. that day, disheveled and appearing distraught. Blood was smeared on his clothing. Doan and Tracey drove away at 4:30 a.m. after Doan showered. They took a gun and some garbage bags. When they returned at approximately 5:00 a.m., both men had blood on them.

A cellmate of Doan's also testified. They had been incarcerated together while Doan was awaiting trial. Doan allegedly told his cellmate that he thought Culberson had been cheating on him and he had to make her pay. He said he lay awake at night thinking of a hundred different ways to kill her.

The defense said that Culberson was probably still alive. They pointed to a lack of physical evidence that would prove she was dead, and dozens of sightings of her and her car after her disappearance. They pointed out that many of the people testifying against Doan had criminal records or were known to be habitual liars.

Doan's father and stepmother both testified that they had visited his house between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. the day of Culberson's disappearance and found him asleep on his living room couch. The defense said this testimony proved he could not have killed Culberson.

During the trial a woman in Cincinnati, Ohio, called 911 claiming to be Culberson and said it was wrong to put an innocent man on trial. Culberson's mother listened to a recording of the call and said the woman was not her daughter.

The jury reached a verdict after four days of deliberation on August 7, 1997. They found Doan guilty of one count of aggravated murder and three counts of kidnapping, determining that Doan kidnapped or tried to kidnap Culberson and she died as a result. They rejected the alternate prosecution theory that Doan killed Culberson to keep her from testifying against him in the assault case.

Doan was sentenced to to life without parole for the murder and nine years for the kidnapping. He has always maintained his innocence in Culberson's case and stated he was wrongfully accused. The 12th District Court of Appeals upheld the Doan verdicts in February 2000.

Payton was later released from his duty as police chief in Blanchester and was accused of assisting the Doan family cover up the murder scene in 1996. He was charged with obstruction of justice but pled guilty to two counts of dereliction of duty, receiving a year's unsupervised probation, a $750 fine, and a ninety-day suspended jail sentence.

Tracey Baker was found guilty of obstruction of justice in Culberson's murder case and sentenced to eight years in prison; Lawrence Baker, Doan's father, was tried but acquitted. Doan is currently incarcerated at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison located in Titusville, Ohio. Tracey was paroled in 2005.

Culberson's family won a wrongful death lawsuit against the city of Blanchester in 2001. The city paid the Culberson family $2 million and pledged to establish a memorial to domestic violence victims and make sure law enforcement officers will be trained further in handling domestic violence complaints. They will also continue searching for Culberson's body.

A plaque with her picture on it will hang in Blanchester Police Department's front lobby until her remains are discovered. She has not yet been located and neither has her car.

Amy Lee Fandel,05-Sep-78,"Sterling, AK",8,White,"4'0""",52 lbs,"Amy and her older brother, Scott, were last seen during the evening hours of September 4, 1978. They had been at Good Time Charlie's, a bar/restaurant in Sterling, until approximately 10:00 p.m. that night with their mother, Margaret, and a visiting aunt, Margaret's sister Cathy Schonfelder. The women brought Scott and Amy back to their cabin at that time and then returned to the bar by themselves.

The cabin the Fandels lived in had two bedrooms and was located in a rural, heavily wooded area off Scout Lake Road, half a mile from Sterling Highway, and south of Sterling. It had a single bright streetlight out front. The front door lock did not work. (The cabin burned down several years after the Fandel children's disappearances.)

Scott and Amy visited their next-door neighbors, the Lupton family, after their mother and aunt dropped them off. They were very close to the Lupton children and walked with them to school each day. After playing with the Luptons, they went home again. A neighbor passing by at 11:45 p.m. noticed lights on in the Fandels' cabin.

Margaret and Cathy arrived back home between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. on September 5, 1978 to find the lights out. This is unusual; Scott and Amy were afraid of the dark and usually left the lights on at night.

A package of macaroni and an open can of tomatoes sat on the kitchen counter, and a pot of water was boiling on the stove. It appeared as if Scott had been interrupted in the process of preparing a macaroni snack, which he liked to eat before bed. Assuming that the children were sleeping at the Luptons' house, Margaret and Cathy retired for the night.

Margaret left for work at approximately 8:30 a.m. that morning; Cathy awoke at 12:00 p.m. and assumed Scott and Amy were at school for the day. Margaret tried to call Amy at school that morning and was told the child hadn't arrived. She became worried, but her boss would not left her leave work.

The Lupton children arrived at the Fandels' home after school and inquired as to Scott and Amy's whereabouts. Cathy learned that neither child had attended classes that day, nor had they spent the night at the neighbor's house. She called Margaret, who immediately summoned the police.

Scott and Amy have never been seen again. Bullet casings were later found outside the cabin; it is unknown if they have anything to do with the children's disappearances. http://charleyproject.org/case/amy-lee-fandel

As Gonangnan had a history of dropping out of sight for a few days, her children were initially unconcerned when she did not come home. There were several unconfirmed sightings of her in the neighborhood in the days after her disappearance.

Gonangnan has a history of residential instability and of abandoning her family, which includes five children, three of whom were living with her in 2003.

She was involved with drug abuse and prostitution and had a violent relationship with her boyfriend, the father of her youngest child, in 2003. The boyfriend is not considered a suspect in Gonagnan's disappearance, however, as he was in jail the day she vanished.

While investigators initially thought Gonangnan had left of her own accord, they now suspect foul play in her disappearance due to the amount of time that has passed since anyone has heard from her. She has not been arrested since her disappearance, and she has not applied for a dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund.

One of her associates, Mahogany Davis, was stabbed to death in May 2002. The murder remains unsolved and it is unclear whether it is connected to Gonangnan's disappearance, which is also unsolved.Êhttp://charleyproject.org/case/marion-gonangnan",,-147.728765,64.828407
Lael Marie Grant,"Oct 24, 2012","Sitka, AK",33,White,"5'2""",90-102 lbs,"Grant was last seen in Sitka, Alaska at 3:00 p.m. on October 14, 2012. She has never been heard from again.

On October 20, her vehicle was found abandoned eight miles outside of Sitka, along the Nelson Logging Road, in the ATV parking lot next to the Tony Hrebar Shooting Range. It contained her grocery store receipts, her favorite pair of headphones, her identification and other items. Authorities determined it had been there since October 18.

An extensive search of the area turned up no sign of Grant. She enjoyed going on solo hikes, but not in the Nelson Logging Road area, and investigators don't know why her car came to be parked there. Sitka is on an island and only accessible by air and water, and you need identification to board a plane or ferry. Grant didn't have any identification at the time of her disappearance, suggesting she hasn't left the island.

Grant had grown up in Sitka and lived there with her two sons, who are now being raised by her mother. At the time of her disappearance she was under a great deal of stress; she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and her father had died. She disappeared two days after his funeral.

Grant was involved with drugs, particularly methamphetamine, and authorities believe she was the victim of a homicide. She was declared legally dead in June 2015. http://charleyproject.org/case/lael-marie-grant

Jael Tiara Hamblen,"Oct 11, 2014","Anchorage, AK",20,White,"5'4""",170-185 lbs,"Hamblen was last seen in the Trailside Loop area in southern Anchorage, Alaska on October 11, 2014. She and her roommate, Kendra Vincent Estrada, went out to dinner together and returned home before 10:00 p.m.

Estrada's children and Hamblen's infant son were being baby-sat by Estrada's mother at the time. Hamblen was thinking of going out again, but her roommate went to bed.

That night, Hamblen was upset because a man she was interested in had rejected her. She texted a male friend at 1:40 a.m., saying she was crying and wanted to get together with him, and she exchanged text messages with another man shortly after 3:00 a.m. This is the last time anyone heard from her.

Estrada texted Hamblen the next day at 10:32 a.m. and Hamblen didn't respond. At noon, Estrada knocked on her door and discovered she was gone and the bed was unmade.

She had taken her purse and cellular phone with her, but left her vehicle, a 1998 Ford Expedition with the Alaska license plate GFB641, parked in the driveway. (She didn't have a driver's license, but did have a learner's permit.)

Estrada initially assumed Hamblen had gone out the night before and stayed out all night, or left home early in the morning. She texted her twice during the afternoon, but got no response and calls to her phone went straight to voice mail. Hamblen has never been heard from again.

A later analysis of her phone showed that neither of Estrada's text messages on October 12 were received, meaning Hamblen's phone was either turned off or the battery had died. She was reported missing by her mother on October 14.

In March 2015, hikers found Hamblen's black purse buried in the snow along a trail in Chugiak, Alaska and turned it into the police. Inside it was her Social Security card and her iPhone 5. Authorities don't believe Hamblen placed it there herself; the weather on the night she disappeared was below freezing, and she didn't enjoy hiking.

Hamblen was born in Washington state and spent the first fourteen months of her life in foster care before being adopted. She was raised her in Wasilla, Alaska, and she also spent time in Washington with her father after her parents divorced.

Growing up, she struggled with cognitive, social and developmental delays, and she was eventually diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Hamblen's mother stated she began rebelling in her early teens, dropped out of high school and and ran away from home for the first time at age seventeen.

However, her family stated the birth of her son gave her purpose in life and lead her to become a more responsible person, and they don't believe she would have abandoned him. Her mother filed for custody shortly after Hamblen's disappearance and is now raising the boy.

Authorities are investigating Hamblen's case as a possible homicide. It remains unsolved.Êhttp://charleyproject.org/case/jael-tiara-hamblen

Loreese Sophia Hennagin,"Oct 10, 1996","Kenai, AK",29,White,"5'4""",120 lbs,"Hennagin was reportedly involved with a robbery in early 1996 in Anchorage, Alaska. She and her boyfriend, Rusty Seaman, allegedly broke into the residence owned by his mother, Joan ""Avis"" McGahan. The couple reportedly stole a large amount of cocaine, jewelry and cash.

Authorities believe that Rusty's brother, Rocky Nestor Seaman, and McGahan planned to murder Hennagin in retaliation for the robbery. Jeffrey Lackey, an area drug dealer, testified that Rocky requested his assistance in the plan. Lackey stated that he accepted cocaine and Rocky forgave his monetary debt in exchange for his cooperation. Lackey said that Rocky instructed him to coerce Hennagin out into an open area near her residence in Kenai, Alaska on October 9, 1996.

Lackey testified that he followed Hennagin to a nearby K-Mart store during the day and pretended to be surprised when encountering her. She agreed to meet Lackey for drinks later that evening. He told authorities that he and Hennagin returned to her apartment afterwards and prepared crack cocaine, then walked to the nearby beach.

Lackey stated that he paged Rocky twice on a cellular phone to signal that Hennagin was in the area. He said Rocky arrived shortly after 12:00 a.m. on October 10 and proceeded to hit Hennagin once in his presence. Lackey said that he fled the scene after witnessing the incident. Hennagin has never been heard from again.

Rocky and McGahan were charged with drug trafficking in October 1997 and imprisoned. They were both charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to kidnap and murder Hennagin sometime afterwards. Lackey pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges and testified against Rocky during his trial in early 2001.

A jury acquitted Rocky of the murder charges, but found him guilty of the two counts of conspiracy in April 2001. He was sentenced to 90 years in prison. Rocky has an extensive criminal history with numerous records of previous assaults.

Hennagin's remains have never been located. Her child was left in the custody of her former husband after her disappearance. Hennagin resided in Kenai since 1981.

Joanne Elaine Coughlin,"December 27, 1974","Youngstown, Ohio",21,Caucasian / White,"5'5"" - 5'8""",120 lbs - 140 lbs,"Coughlin was last seen in Youngstown, Ohio on December 27, 1974, when she supposedly went to the European Health Spa on Boardman-Canfield Road. She had plans to meet her boyfriend at his home on Indianola Avenue later that night, but never arrived and has never been heard from again.

Coughlin's family last saw her on Christmas Day, at the family celebration. Her family was close-knit and she had three sisters. She worked on December 26 and December 27, and told her coworkers she was going to the European Health Spa that night, as she had just gotten a membership for it. Her niece, however, doesn't believe she ever actually went to the spa. She claims the signature on the sign-in sheet doesn't match Coughlin's handwriting and that nobody actually saw her at the facility.

The same day she disappeared, Coughlin wrote a check for her latest life insurance premium and mailed it. Nothing was missing from her apartment on Ohio Avenue except a small suitcase, her hair dryer and her bathing suit. Her four-door 1968 Ford Fairlane with the license plate number H4482G vanished with her, however, and has never been located.

Shortly before her disappearance, Coughlin had received a $3,400 settlement from a car accident. Her mother decided to alert her daughter's bank about her disappearance, in case anyone tried to withdraw money from her account, which was at the Struthers branch of the Mahoning National Bank.

On December 31, four days after Coughlin was last seen, a young woman went to the Mahoning Bank branch located on Midlothian Boulevard in Boardman, Ohio and attempted to withdraw $800 from Coughlin's account at the drive-through window. The teller asked the young woman to come inside and call her mother, and the woman said she would do so after she arrived in Florida. The teller told her she would have to go to the Struthers branch of the bank to withdraw the money, and the young woman left. The teller noted that the woman appeared to be under the influence of drugs.

She never went to the Struthers branch, and the manager of the Boardman branch assumed Coughlin had gotten in touch with her mother and that her disappearance was a family matter. He called Coughlin's mother a week later after he saw an article about Coughlin in the newspaper and realized she was still missing. The signature on the withdrawal slips the woman signed at the Struthers bank branch didn't match Coughlin's writing, and when the teller who handled the transaction was shown a photo of Coughlin, she said the woman who tried to withdraw the money wasn't her.

In January 1975, police were able to identify and interview the woman who had posed as Coughlin at the bank, and she told them she had gotten the bank book from two men who waited at the nearby Point Market while she tried to withdraw the money. The men she identified, Robert Shughart and Howard Rodriguez, were both known figures in the local drug scene. A photo of Shughart is posted with this case summary. By 1975, he was already suspected of having some involvement of multiple murders that had happened in the local area. The killings were believed to have been retribution because all of the victims were either police informants or had spoken about local drug activity.

Authorities tracked down and questioned Rodriguez and Shughart, but they said they knew nothing about Coughlin's disappearance. Shughart said Rodriguez had stolen Coughlin's belongings from a drug party in Warren, Ohio. The men were released after being questioned. Authorities think Coughlin may have known them. Both were acquaintances of her former boyfriend, a married man who used heroin and had gotten Coughlin acquainted with the local drug culture. By the time she went missing, she had ended her relationship with that man and was seeing someone else.

Coughlin's mother wanted to press charges against the woman for the attempted fraud, but the police asked her not to do so, saying she was a potential witness in whatever had happened to Coughlin and they wanted to ""keep her in the background"" to see if she would provide any more information to implicate Shughart and Rodriguez. Neither of the men, or the woman, were ever charged in the attempted bank fraud or Coughlin's disappearance.

Authorities theorize she was robbed and murdered and her car, with the body inside, was disposed of in a quarry near the Pennsylvania border. Witnesses reported seeing a screaming woman being dragged out of a car and into a truck on Villa Marie Road, near the quarries, at 10:00 p.m. on the day Coughlin disappeared, but the woman couldn't be identified as Coughlin and searches of the quarries have turned up nothing.

Coughlin lived in 1400 block of Ohio Avenue at the time of her disappearance and was an aspiring actress who performed at the Youngstown Playhouse and took tap dance lessons. She was declared legally dead in 1985. Her case remains unsolved.

Samantha Kent,"Nov 1, 1993","Anchorage, AK",24,White,"5'3""",105 lbs,"Kent was last seen in her hometown of Anchorage, Alaska on November 1, 1993. Her landlady reported her as a missing person shortly thereafter. Kent disappeared under suspicious circumstances and has never been heard from again. She was employed as a dancer at P.J.'s in Anchorage in 1993, and resided in an apartment on east 24th Street.

Kent occasionally took impromptu trips out of town, but she has never been gone for this long. She had talked about taking a trip to Hawaii with a generous benefactor, but it is unlikely that this was the cause of her disappearance, because her summer clothing and bathing suits were left behind.

She was close to her aunt and uncle, but they have not heard from her since her disappearance. She left behind all her belongings, including her clothing, toothbrush and $300 in cash. In addition, her father died shortly before her disappearance and Kent was expecting a $5,000 inheritance which she never collected.

",100 lbs - 120 lbs,"Carlene was last seen in Rawlins, Wyoming on July 4, 1974. She and a 19-year-old friend, Christine Ann ""Christy"" Gross, visited the Little Britches Rodeo at the fairgrounds that day. Both of them disappeared afterwards, and their vehicle was found abandoned. (Accounts differ as to where; it was either at the fairgrounds or in the town of Worland, Wyoming, over 200 miles to the north.)

Authorities initially believed they'd left on their own, but began to investigate other possibilities as time passed and no one heard from either of the women. A photo of Christy is posted with this case summary.

Two other females besides Carlene and Christy disappeared in July and August 1974 in the Rawlins area. Deborah Meyer disappeared on August 4 while walking to a movie theater, and 10-year-old Jayleen Dawn Banker disappeared on August 23 from the Rawlins fairgrounds. Jayleen's partially clothed body was found in a field on April 24, 1975, eight months after her disappearance; like Christy, she had been murdered, killed with a blow to the head.

Christy's body was found three miles south of Sinclair, Wyoming in October 1983, nine years after her disappearance; she had been killed by two heavy blows to the skull. There was no sign of Carlene at the scene and she has never been heard from again. Deborah has also never been found. Jayleen and Christy's homicides are unsolved.

Royal Russell Long is considered a possible suspect in Deborah and Carlene's disappearances and Christy and Jayleen's murders. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping Sharon Baldeagle and was also charged with the murders of Cinda Pallett and Charlotte Kinsey, but the latter charges were dismissed for lack of evidence.

Long lived in the Rawlins area in 1974 and worked at local fairs and carnivals. He died in prison in 1993 and was never convicted in connection with any missing people besides Sharon. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

Carlene was adopted, and investigators don't know the identity or whereabouts of her birth family. Her adoptive parents divorced prior to 1974. She lived in Rawlins with her father and brother at the time of her disappearance; her mother lived in Colorado. She had graduated from Rawlins High School in 1973; she had been active in many extracurricular activities, including sports, during her school years.

All of Carlene's adoptive family are now deceased. Her case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/14488

Lynn Lynette Bush,"December 8, 1990","Casper, Wyoming",26,Caucasian / White,,,"Lynn was reported missing by her husband, David Labon Bush, on December 9, 1990. He stated he had last seen her the day before, when she went to the Buttrey's grocery store on east 12th Street and Beverly in Casper, Wyoming. She never returned home.

David stated that the next day he found her pickup truck, a 1985 Ford F-150 with vanity license plates reading 1T-BUSH, in the parking lot with the door ajar, groceries in the back and the keys on the ground nearby. A receipt inside the vehicle showed Lynn had purchased the groceries at 5:30 p.m. on December 8.

David stated he did not report his wife missing sooner because he thought she had left of her own volition to get back at him for his marital infidelities. Photographs of David are posted with this case summary. He and Lynn lived in the area of 17th and south McKinley Street. Only a short time after her disappearance, David invited a girlfriend to move in with him.

Lynn's loved ones did not believe David's story, as they did not believe Lynn would abandon the couple's two-year-old daughter, Misty. Lynn's parents won custody of Misty after Lynn's disappearance. David was subsequently charged with several crimes unrelated to his wife's case, including burglary, voter fraud and possession of false identification. Lynn was declared legally dead in 1999. She hasn't used her Social Security number since her disappearance.

In August 2006, David was charged with first-degree murder in connection with his wife's disappearance. Authorities stated they had uncovered new evidence which led to the charges. Among other things, DNA testing proved that bloodstains in the interior of the family's pickup truck and on a vodka bottle inside David's house were Lynn's.

David had allegedly made incriminating statements to others, speaking of having Lynn's body in a freezer and telling cellmates in jail that he had beaten and shot his wife. After Lynn's disappearance, David's girlfriend moved into the Bush home and forged Lynn's name on legal documents. A person who served with David in the National Guard said David had taken several items from the unit, including two body bags, around the time Lynn disappeared.

Misty's counselor and child psychiatrist also testified at the trial. The child had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which her doctor believed was caused by her mother's disappearance.

Between the ages of three and five, while she was in treatment, Misty made multiple statements indicating she may have witnessed her father murder her mother. Among other things, she said ""Daddy cut Mommy,"" and ""Mommy got her head split open and she's dead,"" and that her mother was ""in the mountain."" Misty herself also testified at her father's trial and said she didn't remember anything about her mother's disappearance.

David maintains his innocence in Lynn's case, but he was convicted of his wife's murder in March 2007, after a ten-day trial. He appealed his conviction in 2010, suggesting that it was in fact his brother who killed Lynn, and alleging that at his trial, the court had improperly excluded evidence that would have implicated his brother. Authorities stated David's brother, who has since been imprisoned for sexually assaulting a fifteen-year-old girl, wasn't even in Wyoming at the time of Lynn's disappearance. His murder conviction was upheld.

Lynn's remains have not been recovered, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lynn-lynette-bush,-106.298046,42.838968

Amy Joy Wroe-Bechtel,"July 24, 1997","Lander, Wyoming",24,Caucasian / White,"5'5"" - 5'6""
",110 lbs,"Amy departed from the Lander, Wyoming apartment she shared with her husband of one year, Steve Bechtel, at approximately 9:30 a.m. on July 24, 1997 to run errands for the house they had just purchased and were going to move into. She was seen at a local photo shop at approximately 2:30 p.m. that afternoon; employees at the store said she seemed to be in a hurry and looked at her watch several times.

Authorities believe Amy left the business and drove to Shoshone National Forest to check the course of an upcoming ten-kilometer run planned by her gym. She have have been seen running along the Loop Road; a footprint similar to her sneaker was found there, but it was destroyed before police could attempt to match it. Amy is an avid runner. She has never been seen again.

Steve returned to their residence at approximately 4:30 p.m. He had been socializing with friends and moving items into his new house all day. Steve was not initially concerned for Amy, but he summoned the authorities when his wife did not arrive home by 10:30 p.m.

Amy's white Toyota station wagon was discovered abandoned along Loop Road in the Wind River Mountains near Shoshone National Park shortly after her disappearance. Her keys, her $120 sunglasses, and her to-do list for the day were inside the vehicle, but her green Eagle Creek wallet was missing. There was no other sign of Amy at the scene, nor were there any indications of foul play.

Investigators began focusing on Steve and searched his journals for possible clues as to his wife's whereabouts. Steve wrote about an apparent need for control in his journal and also penned an undated poem that revolved around murdering a person and then hiding the remains.

A woman who was camping in Shoshone National Park on the day Amy was last seen told authorities that she witnessed a truck similar to Steve's vehicle speeding through the park during the early evening hours. The woman stated that she saw an unidentified blonde-haired woman in the passenger seat. It is not known if the incident is related to Amy's case.

Acquaintances of the couple gave conflicting statements about their relationship; some described it was idyllic, but others stated that Steve was jealous and often belittled Amy, and that her demeanor changed whenever she was around him.

Steve's attorney advised him to stop cooperating with law enforcement and refuse a polygraph test. Steve maintains his innocence and believes that authorities focused on him due to a lack of suspects and evidence in Amy's disappearance. He was interviewed only once by authorities; he refused to speak with them further after he said the questions turned accusatory. Steve remarried several years after Amy vanished and still lives in the house they purchased days before her disappearance.

A suspect in Amy's case is Dale Wayne Eaton, who is presently the only inmate on Wyoming's death row. He was convicted of the 1988 rape and murder of an eighteen-year-old Lisa Marie Kimmel.

Investigators believe Eaton may be the so-called ""Great Basin Killer,"" the serial killer whom they think was responsible for the murders of at least nine women in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada between 1983 and 1997. His brother claims Eaton was in the Lander area at the time Amy went missing. Eaton has refused to discuss Amy's disappearance and has never been charged in any other cases besides Kimmel's.

Amy graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1995. She is described as shy, quiet, disciplined and goal-oriented. She enjoys rock climbing and amateur photography in addition to running, and hoped to someday be an Olympic marathoner. Her family continues to search for her, though her father died after her disappearance. Amy's case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/87

She was walking to the Greenbrae Shopping Center, across the street from her family's apartment at Fourth and Greenbrae Streets. She has never been heard from again. At the time of her disappearance, she was considered a runaway and authorities did little to find her.

It's possible that Sandra was a victim of the serial killer couple Charlene and Gerald Gallego, who were ultimately convicted of the kidnapping and murders of several teenage girls in California, Oregon and Nevada.

The Gallegos had abducted two teenage girls from the Sparks fairgrounds on June 24, 1979, a year almost to the day after Sandra vanished.On the day Sandra disappeared, she had gotten permission from her mother to ride her bike to the Reno Rodeo at the fairgrounds. The Gallegos are known to have been in the area that day.

Gerald was sentenced to death in California for murder, and died of natural causes on death row in 2002. Charlene testified against her husband in exchange for a reduced sentence, and was released from a Nevada prison in 1997. She was last known to be living in California under a new name. The police have not been able to interview her about Sandra's disappearance, but they continue to pursue leads in the case.

Maria Bozi,"September 1, 1999","Boulder City, Nevada",46,Caucasian / White,,,"Bozi married David Kent Fitch in England in April 1999. Photos of Fitch are posted with this case summary. The couple relocated to the Boulder City, Nevada area shortly after their wedding. They resided in Lakeshore Trailer Village, which is part of the Lake Mead National Recreational Area.

Fitch was convicted for manufacturing counterfeit currency and selling marijuana in Arizona in 1991. Authorities are uncertain if Bozi was aware of her husband's criminal record.

Bozi was last seen at her residence between September 4 and September 9, 1999. She phoned the caretaker in England on September 4. This is the last time anyone heard from her. Fitch did not report her missing and told their neighbors and her British caretaker that Bozi traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He told park rangers that Bozi returned to Romania to visit her mother, who resided in the country. In the aftermath of her disappearance he disposed of most of her belongings, including her clothes and car.

Citibank attempted to contact Bozi at her home in England during mid-September. The bank was concerned about a series of $1000 withdrawals from her account which started on September 7. All the transactions took place in Hendersonville, Nevada. Authorities were summoned shortly afterwards and Bozi's trailer was sealed, since she disappeared from federal land.

Fitch was pulled over for a speeding violation in Hendersonville in February 2000. He was driving Bozi's Ford Thunderbird at the time. Fitch allowed authorities to search the vehicle, as well as two storage units he maintained in the 4100 block of South Boulder Highway. Investigators discovered firearms and ammunition inside the units, as well as books on how to kill people and how to change your identity.

Authorities arrested Fitch after finding these items; he is not allowed to possess firearms due to his previous felony convictions. Fitch admitted that he made the transactions from Bozi's account after she disappeared. He also stated that he cashed Bozi's check for $40,000 in September 1999.

Authorities learned that Fitch traveled to England in January 2000 and married Patricia Molano Gutierrez, a Colombian national, under the name David Lee Krause. He was still legally married to Bozi at the time of the marriage. Gutierrez was located in England shortly after Fitch's February 2000 arrest. Investigators were initially concerned for her safety, since Bozi vanished after her wedding to Fitch.

Fitch used numerous aliases, including Dr. David, Dr. DK Fitch, James O'Callaghan, Daniel Joseph O'Hare, Michael Bozi and Mario Bozi. Fitch also used the alias David Lee Krause. (He paid the real Krause $200 to borrow his identity.) Papers with Bozi's forged signature were also located in the units. Investigators believe that he attempted to coerce others into posing as Bozi for phone calls in an effort to steal cash from her accounts.

Fitch pleaded guilty to ten counts of firearms possession and fradulent document charges in July 2000 and sentenced to eight years in prison. After his release, he was charged with bank fraud, money laundering and unauthorized possession of Bozi's credit card. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 22 years in prison, nearly seven times the amount suggested by sentencing guidelines. The judge said there was ""clear and convincing evidence"" that he had killed Bozi, although he'd never been charged in her case.

Fitch's father told the media that his son often lied about his lifestyle and career. His family believed that he was working aboard an overseas oil rig at the time he was arrested in Nevada in 2000. Fitch's father said that his son has been married at least three times and has at least five children from previous relationships.

Fitch has never ben charged in connection with Bozi's disappearance, but he remains a suspect. He has maintained his innocence in his wife's case, which remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected in Bozi's disappearance.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2835dfnv.html

There is no record of her checking in at that hotel. 
Palumbo's vehicle was discovered illegally parked and abandoned at the airport on April 27, one day after her disappearance. The majority of her personal belongings were found inside the car, along with her cellular phone and her purse, which contained $600 in cash.
The owner of the Silver Dollar Casino in Elko, Nevada claimed that Palumbo was inside her establishment in December 2000, eight months after Palumbo disappeared. The owner told authorities that the woman became nervous when she saw a man peering through the bar's window during the evening. According to the owner, the woman then departed from the Silver Dollar Casino with another female. Authorities have been unable to confirm if the unidentified woman in the establishment was indeed Palumbo. Foul play is suspected in her case.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/203

They had met on social media a few months earlier. The extent of their relationship is unclear; Moody's mother says it was only a platonic friendship, but police believe Moody and Gurley may have been romantically involved.

Moody was last seen in Detroit on December 4, 2014. Gurley stated they got into an argument that night and Moody walked out of the residence, which was in the 3700 block of Baldwin, at 7:30 p.m. She left most of her belongings behind, including her phone, purse, identification and coat, and she was underdressed for the bitterly cold winter weather. She has never been heard from again.

Moody disappeared the night before she was supposed to take a bus back to Texas. Her family stated it's uncharacteristic of her to be out of touch with them or leave without warning, and they believe foul play could have been involved in her case. She was unfamiliar with the neighborhood and it was a high-crime area; it's possible she was abducted. Her family, however, believes Gurley knows more about Moody's disappearance than she has disclosed.

Moody is originally from Arkansas. She graduated O.D. Wyatt High School in Fort Worth, Texas. At college she was a straight-A student, danced, and was in the school ROTC program. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/27040

Kaylah Nevaeh Hunter,"May 27, 2014","Detroit, MI",6,Black/African American,"4'5""",65 lbs,"Kaylah disappeared with her half-brother, Kristian Justice, and their mother, Alicia Marie Fox, from Detroit, Michigan on May 24, 2014. They had been living with Alicia's husband of four months, Erin Maurice Justice, who is Kristian's father, in the 1800 block of Ardmore Street.

Alicia and the children had moved out shortly before they vanished. Kaylah's father got a text message supposedly from Alicia on June 3, but authorities don't believe she actually sent it. The three of them were reported missing by family members on June 6, after Kaylah missed her kindergarten graduation.

On June 9, Alicia's badly decomposed body was found wrapped in a blanket and dumped in the basement of a vacant house on Penrod Street on the west side of Detroit. She had been shot twice in the head. The house is three doors down from where Erin's cousin lives. There was no sign of either of the children and they have never been seen again.

Erin was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia and charged with first-degree murder in Alicia's case on June 11.

Authorities determined he rented a U-Haul after Alicia's murder and drove it 300 miles between May 27 and May 29, without ever leaving Detroit, before he took a plane flight to Atlanta. He also sold Fox's Chevrolet Impala to a junkyard in Taylor, Michigan; by the time the police tracked it down it had already been stripped.

Timothy Bernard Jones was also charged with evidence tampering, concealing a death and being an accessory to murder after the fact in Alicia's murder.

Authorities believe Erin killed Alicia inside their Ardmore Street residence sometime between May 25 and May 27; they found a bullet hole lodged in the wall and blood spattered on the ceiling of the upstairs bedroom. Jones, who was Erin's friend from childhood, allegedly helped him hide the body. He told police that it had originally been stored in a crawl space in the Ardmore Street house and, at the time he helped move it, the children were alive.

The family's white pit bull was found running loose on West End and Vanderbilt in Detroit on June 19. It had strangulation marks around its neck and cigarette burns on its face and chest. It was picked up by the Southwest Animal Group, given veterinary treatment and placed in a foster home, and was eventually identified as Alicia's dog. It was speculated that Erin sold it to be bred and/or used for fighting. The animal had reportedly been very loyal and protective of the children.

Erin reached a plea deal with the prosecution in September 2015, pleading guilty to second-degree murder and a felony weapons charge. He was sentenced to 45 to 80 years in prison.

Due to the circumstances, Kaylah and Kristian are considered to be in grave danger. It's possible they're somewhere in the Atlanta area, where Erin was arrested.

Lynette Dawn Culver,"May 6, 1975","Pocatello, Idaho",12,Caucasian / White,"5'2"" - 5'3""",110 lbs,"Lynette was last seen in Pocatello, Idaho on May 6, 1975. She left Alameda Junior High School for her lunch break and never returned. That afternoon, she boarded a bus at Hawthorne Junior High School, bound for Fort Hall. She has never been heard from again.

Investigators initially believed she ran away, perhaps to a nearby Indian reservation, but they began to suspect foul play as time passed and nobody saw or heard from her.

Serial killer Theodore Robert ""Ted"" Bundy confessed to Lynette's murder shortly before his 1989 execution. A photo of Bundy is posted with this case summary. He claimed he abducted Lynette and took her to a room at a Holiday Inn, where he raped her, drowned her in the bathtub and dumped her body in the Snake River.

Bundy reportedly provided personal details about Lynette's life in his confession, but authorities have not entirely accepted his statement. They believe Lynette's disappearance could have been connected to four other cases in the late 1970s and early 1980s where Pocatello girls were abducted and killed, cases which Bundy could not have been responsible for.

Lynette was the first of the girls to go missing, three months before Bundy's arrest. In July 1978, 12-year-old Tina Anderson and 15-year-old Patricia Campbell disappeared. Their bodies were found in Oneida County, Idaho in October 1981. 14-year-old Linda Smith disappeared in June 1981, and her body was found in May 1982. The last murder was that of 14-year-old Cindy Bringhurst, who disappeared in June 1983 and was found a month later, south of Pocatello.

All these cases remain unsolved and investigators haven't definitively linked them, but they note that it would be unusual for five girls in that age group to disappear from a relatively small city within an eight-year span. Police are hoping that with new forensic technologies, they will be able to solve the murders and find Lynette's body.

Bundy is a suspect in many disappearances, including those of Nancy Baird, Ann Marie Burr, Julie Cunningham, Susan Curtis, Georgeann Hawkins, Vicki Hollar, Rita Jolly, Donna Manson, Denise Oliverson, Nancy Wilcox, and many other girls and young women. The women continue to be listed as missing persons. Their remains have never been recovered.

Lynette was the youngest of three children, one of whom died before she was born. She was born in Washington and moved to Idaho in 1967; she lived with her family on Fairbanks Street.

She had a good relationship with her family in 1975. She was in the seventh grade, was a good student and was considered a normal preteen, although she did have some problems with school truancy. She remains listed as a missing person.

Bianca Lily Jones,"December 2, 2011","Detroit, MI",2,Black,"2'5""",25 lbs,"Bianca's father, D'Andre Lane, said he was driving his silver 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis in Detroit, Michigan on December 2, 2011, when the vehicle was carjacked at Brush and Custer Streets at 9:45 a.m. Bianca was strapped in her car seat in the back of the car at the time.Lane said while he was driving, a black man driving a small red passenger car with possible front-end damage told him his own car's taillights were broken. He pulled to the side of the road to check them, and then another man approached him, threatened him with a gun, and drove off in Lane's car, with Bianca still inside it.

The thief is described as a 25- to 30-year-old African-American male, about 6'0 and 185 pounds and unshaven, wearing a black shirt, black pants and a brown and black baseball cap.

Lane didn't call 911 himself after the carjacking. Instead, at 9:40 a.m., he called a friend from his cell phone and told his friend what happened, and the friend called 911.

Authorities found Lane's vehicle only about ten minutes later, still running, parked in an alley between Euclid and Philadelphia. This is less than a mile from where it was reported stolen. There was no sign of Bianca at the scene; she has never been heard from again and an extensive search of the city turned up no sign of her.

Bianca's parents were separated at the time of her disappearance, but were on good terms. They had known each other since childhood. Lane lived in the 19300 block of Mitchell, on the west side of Detroit. Bianca lived with her mother, Banika Jones, and her older sister, but both girls were staying with Lane on the day Bianca disappeared.

At the time of the reported carjacking, Lane had dropped Bianca's sister and the girls' older cousin off at school and was driving to Banika's home to pick up some of Bianca's clothes and belongings so she could stay with him until Christmas.

After he reported her abduction, Lane was taken into custody on an unrelated charge. He was released three days later. Authorities questioned him extensively and gave him a polygraph, which he failed.

They searched his house four times, with his consent, finding ""a significant amount of evidence."" A cadaver dog detected the scent of human remains in a bedroom at Lane's house, as well as in his car and on Bianca's car seat and her blanket. The dog was able to pick Lane's car out of a lot of 32 vehicles.

Less than two weeks after the reported carjacking, investigators told the media they expected to file criminal charges against Lane in his daughter's disappearance.

In March 2012, Lane was charged with first-degree felony murder, first-degree child abuse and being a habitual offender. Investigators believe he beat Bianca to death the night before her disappearance after she wet the bed.

Banika hadn't packed any diapers when she sent Bianca to stay with him, because Bianca was excited about getting new underwear and no longer wanted to wear diapers. She knew he had spanked Bianca before while potty-training her, but said she had no reason to think her daughter was unsafe around her father.

Lane's girlfriend, who was at the house on the night of December 1, heard him yelling at Bianca and hitting her with a paddle, and Bianca screaming. Lane's fifteen-year-old nephew, who was staying at the house that night, witnessed the paddling himself at 2:00 a.m.Lane admitted he had done it but said he hadn't really hurt her. Lane further stated that after the paddling, at 1:00 a.m., Bianca fell out of bed and hit her head.

He said he was unable to sleep that night and after Bianca woke up, she stayed awake with him until 3:00. In the morning, he said, Bianca seemed ""a bit out of it"" and was stumbling around and kept ""nodding out,"" and he repeatedly tapped the paddle against her buttocks to keep her awake.

Lane left the house with his nephew and daughters between 7:45 and 8:00 a.m. Bianca was in her car seat and completely covered with a blanket. Bianca's older sister said Bianca never tried to pull the blanket off her face while Lane was driving her and her cousin to school, and never made a sound, although she usually snores when she sleeps. Bianca's sister also said she herself had wet the bed once, and her father had hit her and forced her underpants into her mouth.

Bianca's father was found guilty of felony murder and first-degree child abuse in October 2012; the mandatory sentence was life in prison without parole. He maintains his innocence.

Bianca's body has never been found, and her mother remains hopeful that she is alive. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/13197

She has never been heard from again. She was estranged from her parents and four daughters at the time of her disappearance, and because of this she wasn't reported missing until 2013.

Stephanie Lyn Crane,"October 11, 1993","Challis, Idaho",9,Caucasian / White,"4'2""",65 lbs - 85 lbs,"Stephanie's mother gave her money for a snack and dropped her off at the Challis Bowling Alley in Challis, Idaho on October 11, 1993. She went bowling with friends, then departed at approximately 4:45 p.m.. She was last seen walking on Highway 93 towards Challis High School at approximately 6:00 p.m. that evening. The school was across the street from the bowling alley.

Accounts differ as to whether Stephanie was going to the high school for soccer practice, or whether she was heading for her family's residence, about 500 yards away. By 8:15 p.m., she hadn't arrived home and her parents notified the police. An extensive search covering 7,000 square miles in two counties turned up no sign of her. A yellow pickup truck with red pinstripes was seen in the area around the time she vanished, and may be connected to her disappearance.

Keith Glenn ""Mark"" Hescock has been investigated for possible involvement in Stephanie's case, and also the disappearance of Amber Hoopes. Hescock kidnapped a fourteen-year-old girl from outside her home in the early morning hours of June 5, 2002. He had known her family. The girl was able to escape that afternoon when he went to work, leaving her chained to a bed in his home. When the police attempted to arrest him, Hescock fled in his vehicle and lead them on a forty-mile high-speed chase, which ended at a dead-end road in the Big Hole Mountains. There he shot and killed a police dog, shot and wounded an officer, and then committed suicide.

Hescock had previously worked for Hoopes's grandparents, and his neighbor says he was hunting in Challis the weekend Stephanie disappeared from that location. He also owned a yellow pickup truck similar to the one that may be connected to Stephanie's case, and Stephanie's great-grandparents believe he was the ""weird guy"" with a yellow pickup truck who camped next to them when they went camping near Twin Peaks, Idaho the weekend before Stephanie went missing. Authorities have not been able to link Hescock to either Stephanie's or Hoopes's disappearance, however. His only criminal record in Idaho had been for poaching, but he had felony convictions in other states.

Authorities have five to ten persons of interest in Stephanie's case, none of whom are family members. One of them, a woman, refused to answer any questions without an attorney present; another, a man, took a polygraph on the case and his answers were ""deceptive but inconclusive.""

Investigators believe Stephanie was taken against her will by a stranger. Her case remains unsolved. She has three younger sisters and is described as a tomboy who was part of the youth bowling league and enjoyed going hunting and fishing with her father. Her parents divorced in mid-1994 and both of them are now deceased; her mother died in 1997 and her father in 2012, both of natural causes. Her sisters and many members of her extended family are still alive, however.

Randa David Jawhari,"February 10, 2009","Fenton, Michigan",42,Caucasian / White (Lebanese),"5'1""",100 lbs,"Jawhari was last heard from at 11:30 p.m. on February 11, 2009, when she spoke to a family member on the phone and said she was going to bed. She lived in the 3400 block of Shiawassee Avenue in Fenton, Michigan, a quarter-mile east of U.S. 23.

At 8:00 a.m. the next day, a ride service arrived at her home for a scheduled pickup, but left after Jawhari didn't answer the door. At 8:30 a.m., after she didn't answer the phone, one of her relatives went to her apartment.

The front door was open, Jawhari's clothes were laid out, her bed didn't appear to have been slept in, the coffee pot was cold, and nothing was missing from the home, not even her coat, identification or cigarettes.

She has never been heard from again. The apartment building's surveillance camera doesn't show her in the parking lot during the night of February 11 or early morning of February 12.

Jawhari normally kept in very close touch with her family, which includes her parents, a brother, six sisters, and a five-year-old daughter whom her mother was caring for. She called her relatives several times a day and they checked in on her personally every day. She spent a great deal of time participating in programs in Flint, Michigan and may be in that city.

Jawhari didn't have a cellular phone, a vehicle or a driver's license when she disappeared and walked places or depended on others for transportation. She apparently didn't have any money at the time she went missing. A few days before she vanished, a police officer picked her up after someone reported she was panhandling at a local fast food restaurant. He drove her back to her apartment.

Police have released a sketch of an unidentified person of interest in Jawhari's disappearance. The sketch is posted with this case summary. The man accompanied Jawhari to dental appointments five times in October and November 2008. He seemed impatient waiting for her and repeatedly asked how much longer she would be.

The man is described as 30 to 35 years old and clean-cut. He wore a black leather jacket and silver neck chains. He's not considered a suspect in Jawhari's disappearance, but investigators would like to talk to him and found out if he's heard from her since she vanished.

Jawhari was born in Lebanon and moved to the United States as a child. She has previously lived in Hawaii and in Miami, Florida and she has relatives in the Cleveland, Ohio and Parma, Ohio areas. She is described as a talented, artistic person who enjoys painting, acting and writing poetry. Her mother has legal guardianship over her.

Although she is incapable of adequately caring for herself due to her illnesses, Jawhari had seen a physician not long before her disappearance, and she was feeling well and adequately managing her medical conditions. She doted on her daughter and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her case remains unsolved.

Jawhari suffers from bipolar disorder, depression and other medical conditions. She very weak, requires medication and is considered to be legally incapacitated. Jawhari is supposed to take her bipolar disorder medication by injection every fifteen days, but she prefers alternative treatments and had been refusing to take her medication for about three months before her disappearance.

Jawhari is of Lebanese descent. She may use the first name Brandi. She has pierced ears and a Cesarean section scar on her abdomen. Some of her molars are missing and she wears a partial dental bridge. Jawhari chain-smokes cigarettes. She tends to walk at a very slow pace.

Renee Lynette Kyles,"September 8, 2007","Kalamazoo, MI",53,Black/African American,"5'3""",115 lbs,"Police have said that Renee's disappearance is highly suspicious. Although there were no signs of foul play in the car, detectives fear that Renee is the victim of something criminal. 

A family member reported that Kyles was last seen Sept. 8 at a residence on Southworth Terrace in Kalamazoo, police have said.

Investigators found Kyles' car Sept. 19 in the 1900 block of Portage Street. Eyewitnesses in Renee's daughter's neighborhood told police they last saw her getting into a Pontiac Vibe on Saturday, September 8, 2007. Police say there was also a possible sighting of Renee in a large SUV that could be a Nissan Pathfinder.

Police had hoped Kyles' food-stamp card would have been helpful in tracking her whereabouts. Unfortunately the card had not been used since her disappearance.

Renee was last known to be living with her sister in Kalamazoo, but has family throughout the Midwest, specifically in Chicago and Kalamazoo.",https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/7715,-85.5598925,42.2999767

Mitchell said Loatman's car, a red 1997 GMC Safari with the Michigan license plate number 3GPQ44, had a flat tire. Her boyfriend asked to speak to her and the man put Loatman on the phone.

Its two front tires were missing.

It's uncharacteristic of Loatman to leave without warning or to be out of touch with her three adult children, with whom she was in regular contact. Her purse disappeared with her and has not been located. Loatman's case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/10624

Her landlord came by to make a repair and saw her eating Chinese food and ironing clothes, with a piece of delicate soaking in the sink. She has never been heard from again.

When she was reported missing and her landlord returned to the apartment with the police, it was in the same condition the landlord last seen it; she said it looked like Brown-Bousetta had stepped out to run an errand and intended to return shortly. She has never been heard from again. Her white 1995 Chrysler Cirrus LX was later located abandoned in the parking lot of a gas station near her apartment.

Brown-Boussetta is originally from Florida. She had married in the summer of 2005, but her husband left her and filed for divorce after less than a year. The divorce was finalized in October 2006, a month after Brown-Boussetta's disappearance, when she failed to appear at court dates. Her ex-husband was not even aware she had disappeared until the Pittsburgh Police Department contacted him in 2008.

She has a young daughter from a prior relationship, and had a custody dispute with the child's father.

Angela Lynn Chan,"March 27, 1989","Redmond, Oregon",19,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",180 lbs,"Angela was last seen by her husband of two years, Bruce Chan, when he dropped her off at their home in the 1500 block of southwest Lava Avenue in Redmond, Oregon on the morning of March 27, 1989.

They had been trap shooting together. After he dropped her off, Bruce returned to his station at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, California, where he served at a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

Two days later, on March 29, Angela's family members reported her missing. Her yellow Datsun B-210 was found that same day in a pullout along Highway 126 near the Cline Falls Bridge, west of Redmond. It was still operable and had fuel in the tank, but the passenger window had been smashed in with a rock. Angela's shoes and purse were inside the vehicle. She has never been heard from again.

Bruce and Angela were separated in 1989; he was at Camp Pendleton, and she had moved back in with her mother in Redmond and was seeing another man. She told her mother she wanted a divorce and was going to tell Bruce when she saw him on the day she vanished.

In spite of the problems in her marriage, her family stated she was happy and planned to move forward with her life. Authorities believe Bruce may have been involved in her disappearance, but there is no evidence to support this theory besides the circumstances. He now lives in Arizona.

Although authorities initially believed she'd left of her own accord, Angela is now considered to be missing under suspicious circumstances. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/997dfor.html

Her mother's live-in boyfriend, William Russell Spear, took her with him when he went on a fishing trip that day. Annalycia did not have a car seat and traveled in an open backpack.

After he finished fishing, Spear drove with Annalycia to Clyde's Market and left her in the car for a few minutes while he stepped inside to buy an apple. When he came out, she was gone.

Spear drove home to Sprague River, Oregon and asked Annalycia's mother, Alice R. Fowler, if she had picked up the baby. They went back to Clyde's Market, looked around for Annalycia and asked people if they had seen her. They didn't report her disappearance to the police until 6:19 p.m., nearly an hour after Spear last saw her.

Investigators retraced Spear's steps, but found little evidence as to Annalycia's whereabouts. Spear did stop at a Sprague River gas station before his fishing trip and the attendant remembered hearing an infant crying in the car.

This is the last time anyone besides Spear could confirm Annalycia's whereabouts. The gas station attendant died only a couple of days after the baby's disappearance, however.

In 1995, Fowler sued Spear for $4 million in damages relating to Annalycia's disappearance; she claimed his negligent babysitting caused the infant to vanish. The lawsuit was later dismissed for lack of evidence supporting Fowler's claim.

Spear is considered a person of interest in Annalycia's case, but investigators can find no evidence of any crime. She is believed to be missing under suspicious circumstances. Police believe foul play was involved in her disappearance, and stated their investigation had taken them out of state. Her case remains unsolved.

She was living with her adult son, John Shipman, at the time of her disappearance; she had moved in with him after leaving a retirement center in Bend, Oregon. After she vanished, Shipman said his mother was traveling with Walter Cierley, who disappeared in July 1998. Cierley had been married to Brewster's late sister, making him Brewster's brother-in-law.

In May 2000, one of Brewster's other sons reported her missing. Her relatives had become worried because they had not heard from her for such a long time. Subsequent investigation revealed Cierley's disappearance as well.

Police discovered that Shipman was cashing both Brewster and Cierley's Social Security benefit checks after they disappeared. When they tried to arrest him on some unrelated domestic violence charges in September 2001, he killed himself with a shotgun. Federal indictments related to the check-cashing were pending against him when he died.

Although Shipman never admitted to involvement in his mother and uncle's disappearances, authorities believe he murdered them both and buried their bodies somewhere in central Oregon.

Brewster and Cierley have never been located. Foul play is suspected in their cases due to the circumstances involved.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2777dfor.html

Judith Ann Mattise,"May 19, 2003","New Haven, MI",55,White,"5'7""",145 lbs,"Judith was last seen on the afternoon of May 19, 2003 in New Haven, Michigan, driving her silver 2003 Chevrolet Impala, which has dark tinted windows and Michigan license plates numbered 3AQW95.

A neighbor who saw Judith two days before she vanished reports that she was unusually quiet at the time. She was reported missing by her daughter two days after she was last seen. Judith resided in the 59800 block of Cynthia in New Haven.

On May 22, Judith's estranged husband, James David ""Jim"" Mattise Sr., 61, was found dead at 9:30 a.m. in downtown New Haven in his Ford pickup truck, which was parked between two church vans. He had strangled himself with a plastic zip tie and left a suicide note addressed to his children, the wording of which implied that he was involved in his wife's disappearance. The note said she might be found in a ""large pile."" Based on the information in note, authorities searched the local Pine Tree Acres landfill and located no evidence. James and Judith's children describe the search as perfunctory.

Investigators theorized that the case may have been a murder-suicide. James and Judith's three children also believe their father was responsible for their mother's disappearance.

Their son looked in the trunk of James and Judith's other car, which was at their second home in Las Vegas, Nevada. He found, among other things, a tarp and some rope. Such items could be used to transport a body.

James and Judith's children theorize that James killed Judith on the night she was last seen, then put her remains in their company's dumpster which is emptied between 6:00 and 7:00 a.m. ever day. Their oldest son smelled cleaning products when he went to Unlimited Services at 4:30 a.m. on May 20, and when the family looked in the company trash bin the next day, the same odor was present there.

The children have criticized police for not looking harder for Judith. Investigators have said that the children would benefit financially if Judith was found; much of the assets of Unlimited Services were in her name only. James and Judith's children are continuing to run the company.

In September 2003, Judith's abandoned car parked outside an abandoned house on Adelaide Street near Comerica Park in Detroit and towed. It had apparently been left there for months. A parking ticket dated July 3 was on the windshield; the car had apparently not been moved since the ticket was written.

In October 2003, police announced that evidence relating to Judith's case had been found inside the vehicle. Her purse, containing cash and personal items, was located in the car. There was no evidence indicating Judith's whereabouts, however.

Judith was declared legally dead in August 2004, 15 months after her disappearance, after authorities convinced a judge that James had murdered her before completing suicide. Police stated that if James had not killed himself, they would have had him arrested for murdering his wife whether or not her remains were ever recovered.

Theresa Anne Yakinchuk,"June 1, 1973","Edmonton, AB",23,White,"163 cm (5'4"")",55 kg (121 lbs),"Teresa Yakimchuk and her husband, Ronald Yakimchuk left Edmonton, Alberta on June 9, 1973 to head east to Montreal, in a battered Volkswagen Beetle. They were going to attend a wedding on June 16, 1973, then head to the Maritimes, where Ron hoped to land a teaching position and Terry, an Edmonton Journal reporter, intended to seek work as a journalist. En route, they stopped to visit friends near Brandon. The next day, they stopped in Dryden, Ontario, and mailed a one-word postcard to Edmonton. 
They did not go to the wedding and have never been seen or heard of since.

They traveled in a 1959 Volkswagen Beetle, red with a green hood, green fender and Alberta license CA3-262. The car was filled with a white, three-metre kayak and boxes of clothes, books and household goods. 
Their bank accounts have never been touched and their Volkswagen has never shown up anywhere. Ron's life insurance has never been collected. The couple has never been declared dead. There was talk the couple was planning to go to Europe, but police say only Terry had a passport. They may have decided against staying on the narrow, hilly Trans-Canada Highway and headed south, crossing the U.S. border at International Falls and on to Duluth, MN. It's unclear whether police ever checked on that possibility, or if there are records of their entry into the U.S.

Terry is described as an early feminist, and a free spirit who drank scotch whiskey, rolled her own cigarettes and dragged pals off on adventures. Friends say she often acted on impulse.

She departed from their home during the evening hours of May 27, 1994 and planned to drive to her cousins' residence in Pontiac, Michigan. She was traveling alone, driving her black two-door 1987 Ford Escort with the Georgia license plate number FRY137.

At 6:00 p.m. on May 28, Jody called her family and said she thought she was in Erie, Michigan and that she was lost. It's unclear whether she was actually in Erie or not. She was never seen or heard from again.

Jody's vehicle was discovered abandoned and burned along a rural road in Ottawa Lake, Michigan, near Interstate 75 and two miles north of Toledo, Ohio, at 7:00 a.m. on May 29, 1994. Authorities determined the fire had been intentionally set on the front seat of the car.

The keys were in the ignition when the fire began, and Jody's suitcases, severely burned, were still inside the car. The driver's seat had been pushed all the way back; Jody drove with the seat pushed forward. There was a dent in the car's back fender that hadn't been there before. There was no sign of Jody at the scene and an extensive search, with dogs and a helicopter, turned up no sign of her.

Jody's home life was somewhat chaotic, as her mother struggled with addiction issues. Jody had dropped out of high school and taken a job at a fast food restaurant; she bought the car with her earnings.

Several days before her disappearance, she had driven about ten pounds of marijuana from Georgia to Michigan with two male friends, and was paid a few hundred dollars for doing so. She drove straight from to Michigan and straight back, and as soon as she got home she began doing laundry and packing for another trip to Michigan, which turned out to be her last. The last trip wasn't a drug run but was only to visit her relatives.

It's unknown whether Jody's involvement with drugs had anything to do with her disappearance. No suspects or persons of interest have ever been named in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/10117?

Danielle Imbo,"February 19, 2005","Philadelphia, PA",34,White,5'5,118 lbs,"Imbo and her boyfriend, Richard Petrone, were last seen at Abilene's (sometime's spelled ""Abeline's"" or ""Abiline's""), a bar and restaurant in the 400 block of South Street Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 2005.

They had drinks with friends at the establishment before leaving between 11:30 and 11:45 p.m.; they stated they were going to Imbo's home in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Neither of them have been heard from again. Their friends stated that both of them behaved normally and seemed happy that evening.

Petrone's vehicle is also missing: it's a black and silver four-door 2001 Dodge Dakota or Dodge Ram pickup truck with the Pennsylvania license plate number YFH2319 and possibly a NASCAR #99 sticker in the rear window. Photographs of the truck and license plate are posted with this case summary.

Neither Imbo nor Petrone have accessed their bank accounts or used their credit cards or EZ-Pass cards since they went missing. Their cellular phones have stayed turned off. Imbo's purse and wallet have not been located. She had an appointment with a hair salon at 11:00 a.m. the day after she vanished, but never arrived.

Petrone and Imbo have one child each; Imbo has a toddler son and Petrone has a teenage daughter. Their loved ones stated they would never have voluntarily abandoned their families, whom they were close to. The couple knew each other in high school and began dating ten months before their disappearances after they separated from their respective partners.

Authorities have questioned associates of both people. Petrone and Imbo's estranged husband had allegedly exchanged threats with one another over the telephone and Imbo had made multiple failed attempts to reconcile with her husband, who was involved with another woman.

Shortly before she disappeared, Imbo told her husband and Petrone that she wanted ""space"" from both of them; she was reportedly considering ending her relationship with Petrone altogether. Their loved ones believe foul play was involved in their cases, and both families have accused members of the other family of causing their disappearances.

Investigators stated that very little evidence is available to indicate what happened to Petrone and Imbo, but they have ruled out kidnapping and think a random act of violence is also unlikely. Their disappearances are being investigated as a double homicide, possibly a murder-for-hire.

Imbo was employed as a loan processor for a mortgage company at the time of her disappearance, working out of her home. She lived on Dunbarton Road in Mount Laurel in southern New Jersey in 2005; Petrone lived in South Philadelphia. Both New Jersey and Pennsylvania authorities are investigating their disappearances, which remain unsolved.

She has never been heard from again. She apparently left home sometime after midnight, leaving behind her three children, aged between two and six years old, alone. She also left her purse behind.

Bertha was in the process of a divorce at the time of her 1970 disappearance and was seeing another man. Police have named her husband, Douglas A. Burke, as a person of interest in her disappearance. They had married in 1958. She was seeking the divorce on grounds of cruelty.

In 2003, 33 years after Bertha disappeared, investigators searched for her body with ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs. They concentrated on the driveway of her former home, and a parking lot behind Douglas's former place of work on east 8th Street. Tests indicated that something was buried underneath a concrete slab, but when authorities dug underneath it they found no evidence. Nothing was located during the search and investigators do not plan to search further.

Foul play is suspected in Bertha's disappearance. Douglas remarried after her disappearance and then died in 2008. In his obituary, Bertha was said to have died in February 1970, the month she disappeared. Her case is unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/bertha-louise-burke,-123.442962,48.108592

Althea Dale Blankinship,"May 27, 1973","Port Townsend, Washington",23,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",140 lbs,"Althea and her son Jeffrey were last seen on March 27, 1973. They resided in Port Townsend, Washington. Their roommate, Glenn Allan Bagley, says he dropped them off at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport that day. Althea and Jeffrey planned to travel to Greece to meet her parents, who were vacationing there.

They were supposed to catch a United Airlines flight to New York City and a connecting flight to Greece. There was no record that either Althea or Jeffrey boarded any flights that day. They never arrived in Greece and have never been heard from again.

Bagley is the prime suspect in the Blankinships' disappearance, as well as the 1976 disappearance of his ex-wife, Esther Gesler. Photos of him are posted with this case summary. Although he claimed Althea and Jeffrey went on vacation to Greece, her cousin found Althea's passport in a relative's home in 2002 and it had no entries in it.

Althea was never issued another passport, making it unlikely she and Jeffrey left the country. As Althea's child, he could have traveled on her passport. Her cousin also found a cache of letters from Bagley to Althea. They had apparently had a romantic relationship.

Bagley moved to the Philippines shortly after Gesler disappeared and worked as a civil engineer in the capital city of Manila for many years. He never spoke to Washington police again, although over the years they tried to build a case against him for murder. He died of cancer in the Philippines in February 2016.

Althea was born in Virginia. She graduated from Shoreline High School in 1967. Her case and Jeffrey's remain unsolved and foul play is suspected.",http://charleyproject.org/case/althea-dayle-blankinship,-122.762357,48.117331

Because of a scheduling mixup, there was no one working with her that day.

At 9:00 p.m., when Burns's sister-in-law came to help her close the store for the night, Burns was gone. The store's lights were out, the doors were unlocked and 29 rounds of .22-caliber ammunition were scattered around the building's interior.

Burns's car was found undisturbed in the parking lot. Her eyeglasses and one of her earrings were inside the store fitting room, and her purse was missing. She has never been heard from again.

Authorities announced they were seeking a person for questioning; he was described as 6'3 to 6'4 tall, with dark brown hair, brown eyes and an angular face. He had been witnessed talking to Burns at the store before she disappeared.

Robert Elmore Taylor is the prime suspect in Burns's disappearance. A convicted murderer, he had escaped from a Michigan prison and in January 1978, he robbed a Bothell massage parlor at gunpoint and abducted two of its female employees. One of them was able to get the gun away from him and shot him twice in the abdomen, and he was arrested.

When police searched his residence, they found clothing that had been stolen from Burns's store hanging in his closet, as well as merchandise which had been purchased with Burns's credit cards. Sales clerks identified Taylor as the person who bought the items, signing Burns's husband's name on the credit card slips, and the writing on the receipts matched Taylor's.

Taylor was convicted of kidnapping and robbery in the massage parlor case and sentenced to 240 years in prison. He was never charged in Burns's disappearance because authorities couldn't find her body and because the other charges ensured he would spend the rest of his life behind bars. He was murdered by another inmate in 1979. The investigation into Burns's case stagnated after Taylor's death.

Patricia Bernadette Meehan,"April 20, 1989","Circle, MT",37,White,"5'3""",117 lbs,"Patricia Meehan was involved in car crash while traveling northwest on Highway 200 near the town of Circle in eastern Montana during the evening hours of April 20, 1989. Her car crossed the center line and she struck another vehicle head-on. Meehan crawled out of the wreckage, looked blankly at the driver of the other vehicle, then climbed over a fence near the road and disappeared into the countryside. She appeared to be disoriented at the time. She has never been heard from again.

Meehan was living in Bozeman, Montana at the time of her disappearance; she made ends meet by doing odd jobs for her landlord and working as a ranch hand. She had been distressed and made an appointment to see a psychologist on the morning of April 21. She had asked to move back in with her parents in Pennsylvania, and they agreed that she could come to them after she spoke to the psychologist.

It's possible Meehan has amnesia and may be hitching rides with truck drivers across the country. She likes horses and it's possible she may still be working as a ranch hand, or with horses in some other capacity. Over a year after her disappearance, a woman who was arrested in Washington state was thought to be her, but the individual turned out to be someone else.

There have been hundreds of sightings of Meehan all around the United States since 1989. Based on photographs and videotapes, her parents verified sightings from Montana, Washington, South Dakota and Minnesota in the months following her disappearance. She was never located, however, and her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/8299

Kynande Kalehje Bennett,"September 29, 2002","Whiteville, North Carolina",4,African American / Black,"3'10""",90 lbs,"Kynande's mother, Vertasha McCullough (sometimes referred to as Vertasha White or Vertasha McCullough White) said she last saw her daughter at a K-Mart store at 5:00 p.m. on September 29, 2002. They resided in Conway, South Carolina and were visiting Kynande's uncle in Whiteville, North Carolina that day.

At first, McCullough claimed Kynande disappeared in an aisle of the store, but she later changed her story and said she walked into the store and thought Kynande was behind her, but turned around and the child was gone.

Nobody remembered seeing the child with her mother in K-Mart that day, and video surveillance images of the establishment do not show any images of Kynande. Investigators could find no evidence that she was even in the state at the time. No one other than Kynande's parents saw her in the two days before she was reported missing.

Police claimed that Kynande's mother and her father, Eddie Kevin Bennett Jr., who goes by his middle name, were uncooperative in the investigation into the child's disappearance and that there were inconsistencies in their stories.

The day Kynande disappeared, her grandmother told the Conway Police Department that she suspected the child had been abused. Investigators stated Kynande's parents seemed uninterested in her case and never called to ask for updates. They also reported that McCullough failed a polygraph regarding her daughter's disappearance.

Police executed a search warrant on Kynande's home and her family's vehicles, and took blood and saliva samples from both parents. They later stated that the Bennett residence had been ""sanitized"" with bleach, but they found transfer stains, which come from fluid spatters being wiped, with Kynande's DNA.

Kynande's parents were both arrested in February 2003 and charged with homicide by child abuse in connection with their daughter's case. Investigators said the DNA evidence proved she died in Conway and never went to Whiteville on September 29. That, combined with Kynande's grandmother's testimony, led to the murder charges.

The charges against Kevin were dropped for lack of evidence in October 2005, but additional charges of unlawful neglect of a child and inflicting great bodily harm on a child were added to McCullough's indictment in December 2005.

McCullough maintained her innocence at the trial and testified in her own defense, stating she never harmed Kynande. The prosecution theorized McCullough had abused Kynande and caused her death unintentionally, then panicked afterwards and attempted to conceal the crime. She was convicted of all charges in February 2006 and sentenced to twenty years in prison.

Kynande remains missing. She is described as an intelligent, well-mannered child who could read simple words and count to thirty at the time of her disappearance. She liked the cartoon character Spongebob Squarepants.

She had just left her husband, Lee Brown, and planned to go stay with a friend in Virginia. She never arrived there and has never been heard from again.

Elizabeth's red, white and blue 1976 Chevrolet Vega was later found unlocked and abandoned in the parking lot of the Southern Shores Hotel, near the Kitty Hawk Fishing Pier. Her purse, hat and coat were inside the vehicle and the keys were in the ignition.

Lee is considered a possible suspect in his wife's disappearance. He waited a week to report her missing, and he was apparently drunk when he identified her car. Months after Elizabeth disappeared, Lee moved to Florida. He is now deceased. The couple's daughter stated she didn't think Lee was involved in Elizabeth's case, because he was recovering from surgery when she went missing.

Sandra Kay Baker,"May 25, 2000","Delaware Township, Pennsylvania",46,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",112 lbs,"Baker resided in the 60 block of Folk Road in Delaware Township, Pennsylvania in 2000 with her fiance, William Thomas ""Billy"" Crea Jr. They were planning to marry in October 2000. She had been married six times before and was still legally married to her last husband when she became engaged to Crea. Crea had been married twice.

Crea told authorities that he saw Baker between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. at the Sheetz Convenience Store on Pennsylvania Route 18 in Pymatuning Township near Transfer, Pennsylvania on May 25, 2000. Baker was driving her dark blue four-door 1988 Honda Accord with the Florida license plate number EQ762E and a front vanity plate inscribed with her nickname, Sandy.

Crea said that Baker phoned him at approximately 1:00 p.m. She told him she was in danger and unable to return to their home. Baker promised to call Crea in a few days, then terminated the conversation. She has never been heard from again. A witness saw her driving her vehicle south towards Sharon, Pennsylvania later in the day.

The vehicle was found abandoned at the Shenango Valley Mall the day after her disappearance, and was repossessed by the finance company and sold at auction. Police did not discover the car's whereabouts until 2004, by which time any evidence that may have been inside it was gone.

There has not been any activity on Baker's bank accounts or credit cards since her disappearance, and she has not contacted any of her loved ones. Authorities believe that foul play was involved in her case. In 2005, Crea was publicly identified as a suspect in Baker's disappearance.

Authorities stated that he hired a private detective to investigate Baker around the time that she vanished. The detective, Clifford Stephen Aley Jr., operated the Sloan Detective Agency in New Castle, Pennsylvania. In June 2005, Aley was charged with several felony counts of hindering the apprehension or prosecution of the person(s) who killed Baker.

In an effort to avoid a prison sentence, Aley told authorities that Crea confessed Baker's murder to him. He repeated his claims in open court as well. He stated Crea strangled Baker in an argument because he believed she was having an affair. Supposedly, After the murder he buried her body inside a container five to eight miles from his parents' home.

Prosecutors offered to free Aley provided he was being truthful in his statements and provided he had no physical involvement with Baker's murder, but Aley failed a lie detector test, so the deal fell through. He was convicted of three counts of hindering apprehension in January 2006 and was sentenced to four years in prison. Aley admitted that he lied to police and said he had done so because Crea had threatened to kill his children.

Although investigators stated that they were certain Baker had been murdered, no one has been charged in connection with her presumed death. She was declared legally deceased in 2008. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/sandra-kay-baker,-80.413613,41.329808

Nicole Lynn Bryner,"March 11, 1982","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",3,Caucasian / White,"2'6""",35 lbs,"Nicole's mother, Melody Thomas Childs, told authorities that her daughter was abducted from a shopping cart on March 9, 1982. Childs claimed that Nicole was sitting inside the cart at a Giant Eagle supermarket store at 23rd Street and Jane Street on the south side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She stated that when she turned around for a moment, Nicole disappeared. A photograph of Childs is posted with this case summary. She and Nicole lived in the 2000 block of Sarah Street.

Authorities were skeptical of Childs's account from the beginning; no one else remembered seeing Nicole in the grocery store at all that day. Several days after Nicole disappeared, a letter was found in her mother's home which was purportedly from Nicole's abductor. The letter stated ""Nikky"" was dead and buried. Handwriting analysis determined it was probable that Childs herself had written the letter. An extensive search yielded little evidence at the time and Nicole's case became cold.

Timothy Wayne Widman confessed to Nicole's murder four years later in May 1986. A photograph of Widman is posted with this case summary. He was imprisoned on burglary charges at the time of his claims. He had been Childs's boyfriend and lived with her and Nicole in the 2000 block of Sarah Street in 1982, but by the time of his confession he had ended his relationship with Childs.

Widman said that he slapped the child in March 1982 after she bit his toe, and she fell and hit her head. Afterwards, he was unaware she was seriously injured and Childs put her to bed. She was found deceased the following day. Widman claimed that he and Childs put Nicole's naked body in a green plastic garbage bag and buried it in shallow grave in a wooded area along Timberland Road in Brookline, Pennsylvania. They then reported the abduction to cover up Nicole's death.

People who knew the couple reported that Widman regularly abused both Nicole and her mother, and that Childs was fearful of him. She was still married to her first husband, Nicole's father, at the time she was involved with Widman. Nicole's father lived in Texas in 1982 and was quickly ruled out as a suspect in his daughter's case.

A search was conducted in the region for Nicole's remains, but nothing was located. Widman was nevertheless charged with involuntary manslaughter in her case shortly after his confession, but the charges were dropped in 1987. Prosecutors stated that there was not enough evidence against Widman to support any charges; the law at the time dictated that a body had to be found to prove homicide.

Childs, who moved to Garland, Texas and married after Nicole's disappearance, was arrested in June 1986 and charged with felony counts of hindering prosecution and providing false reports to the authorities in connection with her daughter's case. The charges were dropped after Widman refused to testify against her. Childs died in Texas in 2001.

In September 2006, Widman was charged again with criminal homicide in Nicole's presumed death. Investigators did not have any fresh evidence against him, but it is no longer unheard of for homicide cases to be prosecuted without the victim's body being found, so authorities decided to go forward with the case against Widman. He cooperated with the investigation and, in May 2007, admitted to Nicole's murder and pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

Widman was sentenced to two to four years in prison, with credit for time served. Authorities stated they did not have any evidence to prove intentional murder, as Nicole's body was never located. Widman has apologized to Nicole's surviving relatives. He died in 2011, at the age of 56.

The missing child's report date is listed as March 11, 1982, although Childs claimed Nicole was abducted on March 9.",http://charleyproject.org/case/nicole-lynn-bryner,-79.973195,40.426516
Tracy Ann Byrd,"March 7, 1983","Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania",14,Caucasian / White,"5'0"" - 5'4""
",70 lbs - 105 lbs,"Tracy's mother's live-in boyfriend, Paul W. Greenwald, dropped her off at Bensalem High School in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania on the morning of March 7, 1983. She was a ninth-grader at the time. She was suspended from school and wasn't allowed to attend classes again until her mother met with the principal, but she had kept this a secret from her family.

After she was dropped off, Tracy tried to get her friends to skip school with her but they would not. She disappeared afterwards and has never been heard from again. She was initially considered to be a runaway. There were several possible sightings of her in the local area after she vanished, but none of them were substantiated and police believe they may have been of a girl who only resembled her.

Tracy had run away from home on one previous occasion, after an argument with her mother. She was only gone for one night, however. Prior to her disappearance, Tracy told a friend she might be pregnant. Authorities don't know if she was in fact pregnant or who the father of the baby could be, although Tracy's friend stated she had dated two boys.

Tracy's mother, Jean Louise Byrd, disappeared seven months after Tracy was last seen. Jean's body was located on October 18, 1983 in Blackbird State Forest in New Castle County, Delaware. She had been strangled. Jean had last been seen 11 days prior in her son's apartment complex in Bensalem Township.

She had stopped seeing Greenwald before her disappearance. They had had a troubled relationship and once, in 1980, Greenwald kidnapped her at knifepoint. In November 1984, Greenwald was charged with first-degree murder in Jean's death. He admitted to the killing and pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Greenwald took his own life in his prison cell before he was sentenced in March 1986. He overdosed on some medication. He was never connected with Tracy's disappearance, and it is not known if he was involved.

The runaway theory is now considered an unlikely explanation for Tracy's disappearance; she was close to her mother and her loved ones believe she would have returned home for Jean's funeral if she had been able to.

Greenwald was long considered a suspect in Tracy's disappearance, but investigators no longer believe he was involved. Police have another suspect, a Bucks County, Pennsylvania man, but he has not been publicly named. Tracy's case remains unsolved.

Ilonka Cann,"May 26, 1970","Huntington Mills, Pennsylvania",22,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",130 lbs,"Ilonka was last seen at her home in Huntington Mills, Pennsylvania on May 26, 1970. Her husband of two years, Charles Cann II, saw her at 7:20 a.m. before he went to his teaching job at the Berwick Junior High School.

When he returned home at 3:30 p.m., Ilonka was gone and the couple's fifteen-month-old son was alone in the house, crying in his crib upstairs. She has never been heard from again. Charles reported her missing the next day. An extensive search of the area, including a dive team checking a nearby pond, turned up no indication of Ilonka's whereabouts.

In 1971, the year after Ilonka's disappearance, Charles began seeing another woman, Grace P. Brown. Grace moved into the home he'd formerly shared with Ilonka and took Charles's last name, and the couple lived together until 1987, without Charles ever filing for divorce from Ilonka or trying to have her declared legally dead.

In 1987, Grace filed for divorce, saying her cohabitation with Charles made him her common-law husband. Charles claimed they had never been legally married and he was still married to Ilonka; Grace said they were presumed married in 1972.

Ultimately, the court ruled that Grace and Charles had entered into a common-law marriage on June 1, 1982 and that Grace could proceed with her divorce action. The divorce was granted in 1990. Charles appealed, and the appeals court ruled that, even though he had never tried to have her declared legally dead, Ilonka was presumed deceased as of 1977, seven years after her disappearance.

There has been no indication of Ilonka's whereabouts since she went missing, and the circumstances surrounding her disappearance are unclear.",charleyproject.org/case/ilonka-cann,-76.233598,41.190705

A photo of him is posted with this case summary. He was the prime suspect in Susan's case, but charges were never brought against him. He remarried after her disappearance and continued having brushes with the law.

In 1998, a jail inmate told police Andrew had told him he'd strangled Susan, dismembered her body and dumped it in the ocean off the coast of Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

Andrew allegedly told a girlfriend he'd dumped Susan's remains down a hole in the uninhabited former town of Centralia, Pennsylvania, and threatened to put her in the same hole if she was ever unfaithful to him.

Police are unable to search Centralia because a coal fire, covering miles, has been burning underground there since 1962 and the air above ground is poisoned by coal gas fumes.

Andrew died of a drug overdose in February 2007. Susan has never been located and is considered to be the victim of a homicide.ÊÊ Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Image circa 1974 at age 17",http://charleyproject.org/case/susan-maria-ann-cerritelli,-75.4629652,41.0575608

Brenda Louise Condon,"February 27, 1991","Spring Township, Pennsylvania",28,Caucasian / White,"5'3"" - 5'5""
",110 lbs,"Condon was last seen between approximately 12:45 and 1:15 a.m. on February 27, 1991 in Spring Township, Pennsylvania. She was working as a bartender at Carl's Bad Tavern at the time; it is located in a rural area on State Route 550 two miles north of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, near Interstate 80.

The business was abandoned and unlocked when other employees arrived in the later morning hours. Condon's gray 1986 Mercury Capri was found in the parking lot. The bar's receipts were put away and the lights were off.

There was no sign of robbery or any struggle inside the bar, but Condon's black cowboy boots were located in the men's restroom, neatly arranged. They were the only shoes she had with her that night. Investigators are uncertain if the placement of Condon's boots is related to her disappearance. She has never been heard from again.

It is uncharacteristic of Condon to leave without warning; she is described as a very punctual, reliable individual. She was close to her two young children, and her boyfriend of two years said they had a good relationship. She was reported missing the same day she disappeared, but police didn't begin looking for her until March 2, after she missed a visitation period with her children, which is uncharacteristic of her.

Authorities would like to question three unidentified Caucasian male patrons who were at Carl's Bad Tavern during the evening Condon vanished. It is not known if any of these men are connected to Condon's case; they are simply wanted for questioning. Sketches of the patrons are available with this case summary.

The first patron is described as 38 to 40 years old, 6'2, wearing a bright blue down jacket and jeans. The second was 25 to 30 years old and 5'8, and wearing a black leather coat, a white button-down shirt and jeans. The third patron was approximately 50 years old and 5'8, wearing a short dark-colored jacket, dark-colored slacks and a brown plaid shirt.

It was a slow night at the bar and these men are the only patrons the police have been unable to identify. Certain acquaintances of Condon's have not been cooperative with the investigation, but none of them have been named publicly and none are being called suspects in her disappearance.

Condon's case remains unsolved. She left behind two children, who lived with their father in 1991. She was divorced and lived with her boyfriend in the 1900 block of Harvest Circle in State College, Pennsylvania. She is a former resident of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, where she graduated from Clearfield Area High School in 1980.

In addition to her bartending job, Brenda ran a home cleaning service. She had been working at Carl's Bad Tavern for only two weeks prior to her disappearance. The establishment has since closed.",https://charleyproject.org/case/brenda-louise-condon,-77.741103,40.91554
Andrea Jean Coyle,"December 19, 1978","Altoona, Pennsylvania",30,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",130 lbs,"Coyle was last seen on December 19, 1978. She was living with her grandparents in the 700 block of east Sixth Street in Bellwood, Pennsylvania at the time. She left home at 8:00 a.m. and went to the Woodrow Wilson Adult Learning School in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where she was a student. She went there to turn in her textbooks and collect her grades.

Coyle left the school sometime prior to noon and has never been heard from again. She never picked up her grades. She took all her cash with her, but left behind her identification.

Coyle's sister stated Coyle never fully recovered from her 1971 nervous breakdown. The hospital she stayed in during that time gave her a course of electroconvulsive therapy, which her sister claims ""destroyed"" her mentally.

In 1972 or 1973, Coyle got married. She tried to take her own life in September 1973, and her husband packed up her belongings and sent her home to her parents. She hitchhiked all over the country afterwards, and her family heard from her at intervals of months.

Coyle served in the U.S. Amy from September 1974 to February 1975, when she was discharged on medical grounds. In 1976, she was arrested for a petty crime in Washington D.C., and committed to a hospital, where she stayed from August to October 1976.

She was placed on probation; the probation was completed around the time of her disappearance. At the time of her disappearance, Coyle was being treated on a voluntary basis in the psychiatric ward of Altoona Hospital.

Coyle frequently hitchhiked with truck drivers in 1978. She traveled all around the country and usually only contacted her family every four to six months. She may be traveling across the eastern United States, but authorities believe she's probably deceased.

Coyle has a history of mental illness. She had a nervous breakdown in 1971, was hospitalized and received eight shock treatments. In 1973, she attempted suicide. Her sister stated she was functional as long as she took her psychiatric medication.

She picked up four delivery orders of pizzas, totaling less than $50, and delivered at least one of them, but never arrived back at work. She has never been heard from again.

Ellis's brown four-door 1995 Hyundai Elantra with the Pennsylvania license plate number FDY7311 was located on December 9, two days later, on northbound Highway 95, just north of Academy Road in Philadelphia. There was no sign of foul play at the scene.

Ellis's home on Litchfield Street in Philadelphia was burglarized twice prior to her disappearance, but it is unknown if the crimes are connected to her case. She was a frequent caller at a Philadelphia radio station, but has not called them since December 7. None of her relatives, including her teenage son who lives in Tampa, Florida, have heard from her.

Foul play is possible in Ellis's case. She is believed to have been working illegally as an unlicensed cab driver at the time of her disappearance and investigators believe she may have met with violence at the hands of one of her customers.

She said she would be back by 9:00 a.m. to babysit her granddaughter, but she never returned and has never been heard from again. When her loved ones checked the post office and grocery store, they discovered the mail hadn't been collected and no one had seen her at the store.

Over Labor Day Weekend in September 1990, Cummings's brown 1977 Toyota Celica hatchback with the Washington license plate number UKM-353 was found abandoned in on a forest service road three and a half miles off Highway 410 in Greenwater, Washington.

Greenwater residents said the car had been there since mid-July. A man admitted to finding the car and driving it to Auburn, Washington. Authorities stated he wasn't a suspect in Cummings's disappearance.

It's uncharacteristic of Cummings to leave without warning, and she left behind all her makeup and clothing and hasn't used her bank accounts or credit cards since her disappearance. She was in good health at the time of her disappearance, her marriage was happy, and her family can't think of any reason she would want to leave. Her case remains unsolved.

Rita Marie Bartschot,"August 24, 1990","Seattle, Washington",40,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",100 lbs,"Bartschot was last seen on the morning of August 24, 1990, working in the yard at her deceased mother's home in the 5500 block of 31st Avenue northeast in Seattle, Washington. She has never been heard from again. When a neighbor checked on the house, she noticed the television set was turned on, the cat had been left without water or foot, and the coffee pot was full of coffee that had turned moldy. The neighbor reported Bartschot missing.

Drew Richard Thompson, an unemployed landscaper, was charged with using Bartschot's debit card on September 7, two weeks after her disappearance. A photo of Thompson is posted with this case summary. He withdrew a total of $3,200 from her accounts. Following his arrest, police found another of Bartschot's bank cards at his home. Her vehicle, a blue Honda which had disappeared with her, was found near the University of Washington campus on September 9. There was blood in the backseat.

DNA testing was not very advanced at the time, but forensic experts were able to determine the blood could have come from Bartschot and only 11% of the Caucasian population, and Thompson was excluded as a source of the blood. Several hairs found in the car's backseat were microscopically similar to Thompson's hair. He had five felony convictions prior to Bartschot's disappearance, and authorities described him as a professional thief. His fingerprints were found inside Bartschot's vehicle, and he admitted to having stolen and driven it after her disappearance.

Thompson pleaded guilty to first-degree theft in relation to his withdrawals from Bartschot's accounts. In May 1991, he was charged with her murder. Two of his former cellmates testified at the trial, saying Thompson had told them he killed Bartschot and the police would never find the body. He was convicted of first-degree murder in November 1991 and sentenced to 32 years in prison. He continues to maintain his innocence, and will not be eligible for parole until 2022.

Foul play is suspected in Bartschot's disappearance due to the circumstances involved. She worked as a professor of chemistry at Columbia Basin Community College in Pasco, Washington at the time of her disappearance.",http://charleyproject.org/case/rita-marie-bartschot,-122.340403,47.608998

Details of Disappearance
Moranda was last seen getting into a vehicle with an unidentified drive in the parking lot of the Yakima Sports Center in Yakima, Washington on December 7, 1990. She worked as a prostitute at the time of her disappearance and was also an intravenous drug user. Moranda has never been heard from again.

Another woman disappeared from the same area one month after Moranda vanished. Authorities believe that the cases may be connected to convicted serial murderer Robert Lee Yates Jr. A photo of Yates is posted with this case summary. He is occasionally referred to as the Spokane Serial Killer.

She left with her boyfriend, Alexander P. Lorenzi, saying they were going on a trip to Florida together.

They drove off in a red Ford Explorer with a Pittsburgh Steelers emblem. Kail had packed some bags of clothing and shoes and said she ""wasn't paying for anything"" for the trip. She has never been heard from again.

Kail's cellular phone has been shut off since March 5 and there's no proof she actually made it to Florida. Lorenzi reappeared in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 16.

He gave several different explanations of Kail's whereabouts; at one point he said she was still in Florida, and another time he said he dropped her off in Mount Washington, Pennsylvania, where she had been living with a roommate at the time of her disappearance. Her brother and sister reported her missing on March 19.

Lorenzi is a frequent traveler, taking flights or renting cars to travel out of state. He has been uncooperative in the investigation into Kail's disappearance, and he has a criminal record for charges including theft and assault.

After Kail's disappearance, police searched his vehicles and his home in the 3300 block of Oregon Street multiple times and found, among other things, marijuana, cocaine and a stolen gun; he was arrested as a result. Kail's ex-boyfriend was also arrested after her disappearance for probation violation; authorities interviewed him about her case and don't consider him to be a suspect.

Misty Donna Copsey,"Deptember 17, 1992","Tacoma, Washington",14,Caucasian / White,"5'8"" - 5'9""
",105 lbs - 120 lbs,"Misty was last seen walking to her family's residence in the Tacoma, Washington area on September 17, 1992. She was returning from the Puyallup Fairgrounds in Puyallup, Washington at the time; she had gone there with a close friend, Trina Bevard.

Misty missed the 8:40 p.m. Pierce Transit bus back to her neighborhood in Spanaway, Washington. She called her mother and said she might get a ride with Rheuban Schmidt, an eighteen-year-old friend. Misty's mother didn't trust Schmidt and told her daughter to find someone else to help her.

Misty eventually decided to walk home, a distance of eight miles. A witness saw her at 10:00 p.m. in downtown Puyallup, walking along Meridian toward the westbound onramp of Highway 512. She never arrived home and has not been seen again. She is not believed to have been carrying any money at the time of her disappearance.

Misty's mother reported her missing the next day, after she contacted relatives and Misty's friends and found out none of them knew where she was.

Schmidt said she had asked him for a ride the night before, but he didn't have enough gasoline. His roommate said Schmidt left shortly after the phone conversation. The roommate thought Schmidt had gone out to pick up Misty, but Schmidt denied the story and maintained he hadn't seen her and didn't know her whereabouts.

Police initially assumed Misty had run away from home. One female classmate claimed Misty called her after her disappearance and said she was okay, and another classmate said she thought she saw her on September 21.

Both witnesses knew Misty only slightly, but based on their evidence, authorities closed the case and falsely informed the media that Misty had been found. They refused to reopen the investigation for weeks.

It wasn't until December 1992 that police acknowledged Misty might have met with foul play, and it wasn't until five months after her disappearance that they interviewed Brevard and Schmidt, the last two people known to have seen her.

When she was interviewed, Brevard said Schmidt was supposed to take her and Misty home from the fairgrounds that evening. He told them he couldn't pick them up because he didn't have enough fuel.

Misty called him back and told him how to get inside her house so he could get money and buy gasoline. Schmidt still refused to come, however, saying he didn't even have enough gas to get to Misty's house, which was six miles from his own home.

After that, Brevard said, the girls decided that she would walk home and Misty would take the bus. Brevard stated she and Misty parted ways at approximately 8:45 p.m.

Police later discovered Brevard had lied about part of her story. She hadn't walked home; her 23-year-old boyfriend, Michael J. Rhyner, had picked her up. He had no criminal history as an adult, but at sixteen he was accused of abducting and raping an eleven-year-old girl at knifepoint. No charges were filed in that case.

Brevard stated she offered to let Misty ride with her and Rhyner, but Misty didn't trust him and refused to come with them. Brevard said Rhyner dropped her off at home and she told him Misty had taken the bus.

Police theorized Rhyner returned to the fairgrounds later and convinced Misty to get into his car, but Rhyner denied this, and he later passed a polygraph and was eliminated from the investigation.

When police questioned Schmidt, he confirmed Brevard's story but said he had suffered from blackouts for most of his life and couldn't remember anything that happened after the second phone call from Misty. He said he woke up the next morning, alone at his grandmother's farm near Enumclaw, Washington.

When investigators asked if it was possible he blacked out and harmed Misty, he answered, ""I don't know."" Schmidt took a polygraph exam, but it was inconclusive and authorities felt he was trying to influence the results.

Investigators conducted periodic searches for Misty throughout the remainder of 1992 and into 1993. A small private search party discovered her underwear, jeans, shoes and one of her socks on February 7, 1993, nearly four months after her disappearance. She had worn those clothes on the day of her disappearance.

The clothes were covered in mud and rolled up in a ditch near the intersection of State Highway 410 and Weyco Road, near the Mud Mountain Dam area. It appeared as if they had been exposed to the elements for a long time.

Laboratory analysis showed there was no blood or semen on the clothing, but there were three red paint chips on the jeans. The paint chips have since been lost.

Misty's hair pick and toothbrush were located on February 20, 1993, approximately one-half mile from the location of her clothes. She carried both the items in her purse at the time of her disappearance. In 2009, police completed a DNA test on the jeans; curiously, the DNA didn't match Misty, but came from an unidentified male instead.

Witnesses reported Schmidt had said he knew where Misty's body was: he said it was six miles from where her clothes were found. Schmidt's grandmother's farm, where he said he was the morning after Misty disappeared, is six miles from the Highway 410 ditch where the searchers located her clothes.

Schmidt admitted to making the statements, but said they were untrue and he'd made them up to get people ""off his back."" He agreed to take a second polygraph, and this time he passed.

Authorities continued to view Schmidt as a person of interest in Misty's case, however. In 1996, one of her friends accused him of rape, but after two weeks she refused to press charges. He was convicted of theft in 2000, and his wife got a domestic violence protection order against him in 2006, saying he'd threatened to kill her and burn down her house.

An area man, Cory Bober, was very interested in the Green River Killer, a serial murderer responsible for the murders of numerous girls and women, many of them prostitutes, in King County, Washington in the 1980s.

He had a suspect in mind and persistently pursued law enforcement with his ideas. The suspect was later charged with child rape, but he was not the Green River Killer; Gary Leon Ridgway pleaded guilty to the 48 Green River killings in 2003.

Bober believed the still-unsolved murders of Kimberly DeLange, 15, and Anna Chebetnoy, 14, were connected to the Green River case. DeLange disappeared in 1988 and her body was found later that year. Chebetnoy vanished in 1990, and her remains were found in 1991. Both teens from the same Puyallup shopping center, and their bodies were found within 100 feet of one another.

Because those girls were killed two years and one month apart, Bober suggested another victim would be murdered two years and one month after Chebetnoy, and Misty did disappear at that time. Bober got in touch with Misty's mother shortly after her disappearance and told her his theory.

He maintained contact with her for years, and it was he who suggested the search the Highway 410 area where Misty's clothes were located. This location is only about a ten-minute walk from where DeLange and Chebetnoy's bodies were found. Investigators believe the teens' homicides and Misty's disappearance may be related.

Bober's behavior led both police and Misty's mother to suspect he was involved in her disappearance. He maintained his innocence and agreed to take a polygraph, but then canceled the test.

He has no criminal history of violence or sex offenses, but he did serve time in prison on drug charges after Misty went missing. He isn't considered a serious suspect in Misty's case, as he has a partial alibi for the night she went missing, he is agoraphobic and he has never held a driver's license. He continues to advocate for a resolution in Misty's disappearance.

There has been no trace of Misty since her belongings were located, although an unconfirmed report did place her somewhere in northern Minnesota shortly after her disappearance.

She was an excellent student in 1992, and played softball, basketball and volleyball. She didn't drink or use drugs, wasn't sexually active, wasn't having problems at home and had no history of runaway behavior. Her parents divorced shortly after she was born and she lived with her mother in 1992. Both her parents passed polygraphs and are not considered suspects in her case.

Misty is described as a conscientious and level-headed but naive teenager. Her mother and the police believe she met with foul play, possibly at the hands of a serial killer. In May 2000, the Pierce County Medical Examiner's office issued a death certificate for her, though her remains have not been found. Misty's case remains unsolved.

",130 lbs,"Brazzel was last seen at approximately 1:45 a.m. on May 27, 1995 in Everett, Washington. She was departing from Kodiak Ron's Pub in the 12200 block of Airport Road at State Route 99 South at the time of her disappearance.

Her white 1993 Ford Probe with the Washington license plate number 081GDL was discovered three days later parked half a block from her residence in Keeler's Corner Apartments in the 4500 block of 164th Street southwest in North Lynnwood, Washington.

The passenger window was broken out, but there was no broken glass present. There was a small spot of blood on the passenger door. The car had been driven 25 miles since the last time Brazzel put fuel in it. Authorities located evidence that suggested she made it back to her apartment after returning from the bar. She has never been heard from again.

Brazzel was employed as a hairstylist at the Great Clips salon in Mill Creek, Washington in May 1995. She quit her job on May 25, two days prior to her disappearance, and never picked up her last paycheck. Her mother stated that she had a close relationship with her daughter in 1995 and said that Brazzel visited her daily.

Brazzel's loved ones told authorities it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Extensive searches of the surrounding area produced no clues as to her whereabouts. Her parents are divorced and her father resided in New Jersey at the time of her disappearance.

In May 2011, authorities announced they'd identified Danny Ross Giles as a suspect in Brazzel's disappearance and in the murder of Patti Berry, a 26-year-old woman who disappeared in July 1995 and was found stabbed to death a week later.

DNA had linked Giles to samples from a ""blood-like spot"" on the exterior of Brazzel's car and the crime scene in Berry's case. He was in prison for felony indecent exposure at the time of the announcement, and has other convictions for sex crimes, including a 1987 rape conviction.

Giles was charged with the murders of both women in December 2012. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. He later wrote a jailhouse letter in which he denied having anything to do with Brazzel's disappearance, but admitted having been in her car and apartment, supposedly to buy drugs.

Giles was convicted of Berry's murder in November 2014 and sentenced to nearly fifty years in prison. After his conviction in Berry's case, the charges against him in Brazzel's disappearance were dropped. They were were dismissed without prejudice, meaning they could be refiled in the future.

Several unconfirmed sightings of Brazzel were reported in 1997 after her father appeared as a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/tracey-elizabeth-brazzel,-122.256374,47.886996

Her family never heard from her again. She was reported missing in March 1997.

Cruser frequented Sprague Avenue and Pittsburgh Street in Spokane before her disappearance. She went to the Hoot Owl Club and other clubs no east Sprague.

Pamela D. Bennett,"August 31, 1998","Clarkston, Washington",49,Caucasian / White,"5'8""",140 lbs,"Bennett disappeared from Clarkston, Washington on August 31, 1998. She lived on Beachview Boulevard in the Riverview section of the city.

It appeared as if she'd left home in a hurry: the back door of the house was unlocked, expensive rafting equipment was lying out in the backyard, and nothing was missing except Bennett's car and her dog, a two-year-old Viszla named Daisy. She also hadn't asked anyone to water her plants, which is uncharacteristic of her behavior.

There was a confirmed sighting of Bennett at a Mail Boxes Etc. store in Pullman, Washington a few weeks after she disappeared from Clarkston.

She was reported missing by relatives about three weeks after she vanished from Clarkston. Her dark green 1995 Ford Mustang ragtop was found unlocked and abandoned in the parking lot of the Zona Ria Plaza mall in Tijuana, Mexico, with the keys still in the ignition. There was no sign of Bennett or any foul play at the scene, but the vehicle had been wiped clean of fingerprints.

At the time of her disappearance, Bennett was divorced and dating a man she knew as Joseph Blake, whose real name was Ronald Reagan. He dropped out of sight on July 23, 1998, over a month before Bennett did, after police got a warrant to search his van for drug paraphernalia. On September 3, just days after Bennett's disappearance, police discovered the remains of a methamphetamine lab in Reagan's home in Lenore, Idaho. He had put a $10,000 down payment on the home over a year earlier, but had defaulted on the payments prior to his disappearance.

Police determined Reagan had been the financier for the lab, which produced $13 million dollars' worth of high-quality methamphetamine for sale in California: about 20 to 30 pounds every week. It's unclear whether this had anything to do with Bennett's case, but she is known to have visited the Lenore residence several times. She had confided in her best friend that she suspected Reagan was involved in the drug trade and she wanted to end their relationship.

Reagan and a male accomplice were arrested by Drug Enforcement Agency officials at the San Francisco International Airport in 2000. There were unconfirmed reports that a woman was with the men at the time but escaped from the airport; police believe this woman, if she existed, could have been Bennett. Reagan was convicted of possession of two pounds of methamphetamine and died in prison. He never revealed whether he knew anything about Bennett's disappearance.

Since Bennett's disappearance she hasn't used her credit cards or Social Security number, or contacted any family members. She was declared legally dead in 2007. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/pamela-d-bennett,-117.046623,46.41431

She said she would return at 4:30 p.m. that day; when she did not, her family went looking for her.

Anderson's pickup truck was discovered by her best friend in the mall parking lot, near Mervyn's Department Store. This was at 10:00 p.m. on the evening of her disappearance. The truck was locked. There were no presents, but Anderson's cellular phone and the gun she carried for protection were inside the vehicle.

There has been no activity on Anderson's credit cards, bank accounts, or Social Security Number since December 2. Her friends and family checked pawnshops to see if someone had pawned her distinctive, custom-designed wedding set, but uncovered no clues. The diamond in the ring is flanked in black onyx and set in white gold.

Police say there are no signs of foul play in Anderson's case.

Some reports list she was last seen at her mobile home at the Bon-Aire Mobile Home Lodge, in Iowa City, Iowa.

She was reported missing on September 8, 1975, by the Penn school principal, where she was a teacher. A police check of her trailer revealed her bicycle at its usual place beside the trailer and clothing in a location suggesting she had recently taken a shower. The trailer was orderly and nothing was missing or out of place.

At the time, a series of lie detector tests narrowed the list of suspects. However, one major suspect had refused to take such a test questioning the validity of such tests. On September 10, 1975, Iowa City police drained two city lagoons near the victim's trailer court, but no evidence pertaining to the case was uncovered.

In January of 1976, police armed with search warrants went to an Iowa City tavern where Wakefield had worked, an Iowa City apartment house and a billiard parlor, both managed by her estranged husband. Ashes sifted from an incinerator at the apartment in question were sent to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation Laboratory in Des Moines: Lab analysis of bone fragments found in the incinerator were found to be inconclusive. Subsequently, a stretch of 1-80 north-of Iowa City was also searched by some 20 officers. No official explanation for the search has ever been released. Jane has never been seen again.

She and her daughter, Agueda Arias, were planning to go shopping with Guadalupe's husband and Agueda's father, Gregario Arias Ibal, in Portland, Oregon during the day. They were going to buy clothes for Guadalupe's unborn baby.

Gregario was located, but his wife and daughter have never been heard from again. Guadalupe had been estranged from him at the time of her and Agueda's disappearances, but was considering reconciliation. She and her daughter had lived together with Guadalupe's parents for about a year prior to November 2001.

The vehicle the family had been riding in, Gregario's Jeep Cherokee, was discovered abandoned in Kerman, California sometime after their disappearances, parked at the residence of one of his relatives. Gregario dropped it off there, and left a message on his relative's answering machine.

There was no sign of Agueda or her mother at the scene. They left all their clothes behind, and their disappearances are considered suspicious.

Although Gregario was not a legal resident of the United States and traveled back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico, Guadalupe and Agueda are American citizens and Guadalupe had a job in Washington and close ties to her family and her Pentecostal church.

An anonymous phone caller to Guadalupe's family said that Guadalupe was in Arizona and ill, but the person did not provide specific information. The call was placed from Tucson, Arizona. Authorities do not know if the information provided is accurate.

Gregario's family claims he and his sister, Regina Arias-Ibal, disappeared on the same day Agueda and Guadalupe did. Photos of the siblings are unavailable. Regina's date of birth is April 2, 1982, making her 19 years old at the time. She's described as Hispanic, 5'2 and 110 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. Gregorio's date of birth is February 28, 2000; he was 21 years old. He's described as Hispanic, 5'8 and 140 pounds, with black and hair and brown eyes.

Guadalupe's father believes Gregario was involved in their daughter and granddaughter's disappearances. He theorizes Guadalupe was murdered but Agueda may still be alive and in central Mexico, where both her parents are originally from.

Merrian Lynn Carver,"August 28, 2004","Seattle, Washington",40,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",100 lbs,"Carver lived in Boston, Massachusetts in 2004. She took a vacation cruise on the ship Mercury, owned by Celebrity Cruise, in August 2004. Carver boarded the vessel in Seattle, Washington on August 27. She was last seen by a cabin attendant the next day, August 28.

The ship made stops in Juneau, Skagway, and Ketchikan, Alaska and in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, but Carver did not disembark in any of those places. The cruise ended on September 3 when the Mercury docked in Vancouver, British Columbia. It has not been established whether or not Carver got off the ship then. She did not board her airplane flight back to Massachusetts and has never been heard from again.

Carver's family reported her missing on September 7. They had not realized she had gone on a cruise. The detective investigating her case found out she had gone on vacation when he accessed her credit card records.

Carver's father called the cruise line and was told she had boarded the ship, but had disappeared during the cruise. She left her personal belongings, including clothing, behind in her cabin on the ship when she disappeared.

The cruise line did not report Carver's disappearance until they heard from her father. They gave most of her possessions to charity and put her purse, which contained papers, computer disks, and her keys, into storage. The employee who ordered this was subsequently fired, as the cruise line's own regulations state that a passenger's absence should be reported to the security office.

Subsequent investigation showed that Carver never used her Sea Pass, an onboard credit card which also serves as identification. She never bought a drink on board and she is not recorded as having left the ship on any of its stops, though the ship does not keep records of passengers getting off in Vancouver.

Carver's parents sued the Celebrity Cruise company over her disappearance in March 2005. In response to the lawsuit, cruise officials issued a statement saying they believed Carver committed suicide by jumping overboard. Her cabin is only a short distance from an open-air deck.

Carver had threatened to harm herself after her divorce several years prior to her disappearance, but her family does not believe she took her own life. She is described as a vivacious, independent person who enjoys writing poetry. She has work experience as an investment banker, but was unemployed and living off a trust fund and her investments at the time of her disappearance. She has one child.

Danica Dianne Childs,"December 21, 2007","Federal Way, WA",17,Biracial (White/Black),"5'3""",107 lbs,"Danica disappeared from Federal Way, Washington on December 21, 2007. She was staying at a friend's house at the time. She spoke to her mother, Dianne Zoro, on the phone that day and said she was going Christmas shopping with her sisters and friends and would be home later. Her family never heard from her again.

Her purse, coat and cellular phone were found a short time later at the Sunset Motel in Kent, Washington; it turned out Danica had spent the night there before her disappearance, and left the items behind. The Sunset Motel is noted for drug and prostitution activity, and messages on Danica's phone indicated she had been working as a prostitute, something her family was unaware of.

Zoro was able to break the passcode on the phone several days after Danica was last seen. The messages left on it hadn't been listened to before, and they started being left shortly after Zoro last spoke to her daughter, indicating Danica may have disappeared not long after her conversation with her mother.

Danica had been a very good student in high school and was recommended for a dual enrollment program where high schoolers could attend community college and earn high school and college credit at the same time. In spite of her prior academic success, she struggled at the dual enrollment program and transferred to an alternative school. She briefly dropped out of school with the plan to seek her GED, but changed her mind and re-enrolled in school. She was on track to graduate when she went missing.

While she was in the dual enrollment program, Danica met another student whom she was dating at the time of her disappearance. It wasn't until after she went missing that Zoro found out Danica's boyfriend was a pimp. She believes her relationship with this man was what lead her into prostitution.

Authorities believe Danica left of her own accord and may be in the company of an adult male. Her mother, however believes she may have been the victim of human trafficking and may be being held against her will. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/5944

She was a freshman marine biology major at Walla Walla University and disappeared while on a three-day trip to the university's Rosario Beach Marine Laboratory near Anacortes with her advanced scuba diving class.

The class was taking one of about six dives and Booth went diving with a partner, as part of a larger group. She did not resurface and an extensive search of the water turned up no sign of her. She is presumed to have drowned.

Her mother, Marsha Booth, sued Walla Walla University and Shari's diving instructor, Gene Bruns, for Shari's wrongful death, alleging the training and materials used in the diving course were deficient and that Shari wasn't appropriately screened, properly instructed or adequately prepared for the dive. Marsha also alleged the dive location was inappropriate and that Bruns demonstrated ""reckless indifference"" when he failed to enter the water to try to save her.

In September 2016, the lawsuit was settled out of court. Neither side admitted any liability and the terms of the settlement have not been publicly disclosed.

Her grandmother spoke to her on the phone at 6:30 p.m. on April 9, 2009. McLemore's mother was dying of scleroderma, a serious autoimmune disease, and on April 9 her grandmother told McLemore that her mother's condition was worsening. McLemore assured her grandmother that she would come home. A witness reported seeing her in Kent that day, near 30th Avenue South and Kent-Des Moines Road. The witness saw a green 1990s model pickup truck, possibly with Oregon license plates, approach McLemore. She has never been heard from again. Her mother died three days later, but her family was unable to get in touch with her.

Authorities discovered McLemore's cellular phoned dialed 911 at 9:15 p.m. on April 10, the day after she was last heard from. The dispatcher heard a woman asking for help, but the phone did not have a GPS sensor and its exact location could not be determined before the line went dead. Authorities believe the call came from the Kent area, however. The caller has never been identified, and the phone went out of service a few days later.

A witness reported seeing McLemore some time before her disappearance with an unidentified male known to her. The man is described as Caucasian, in his 50s or 60s, about 5'8 inches tall and 175 to 185 pounds. He drove a green pickup truck. It's unclear whether he had anything to do with her disappearance.

McLemore has a daughter who was three years old in 2009. At the time of her mother's disappearance, the child was staying with her father, McLemore's boyfriend. Her boyfriend describes McLemore as a devoted parent who would not have abandoned her daughter. She was unemployed at the time of her disappearance, and very close to her mother. McLemore enjoys dancing and roller skating. She dropped out of Kent-Meridian High School in her sophomore year.

Due to the circumstances of her disappearance, McLemore is considered to be in danger. Her grandmother moved to Auburn, Washington after her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.

Brach and Sons and was one of the world's wealthiest candy producers. He met Helen, a native of Ohio, when she was working as a coat-check girl at the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida.

After their marriage they lived in Chicago, Illinois during the summer and rented a house in Palm Beach, Florida in the winter. Frank and Helen apparently had a very happy relationship. He died in 1970, seven years before Helen's disappearance. He left her with an estimated net worth of $20 million.

Matlick claims he met Helen at O'Hare International Airport when she flew from Rochester back to Chicago, but the plane crew, could not remember anyone matching her description on the flight that day. They were not interviewed until a significant period of time had passed, however.

Matlick says he picked up Helen at O'Hare and drove her back to her home in Glenview, Illinois. That weekend, Matlick called his wife and said he would be staying in Glenview because he had work to do. This is uncharacteristic of him; he normally lived apart from Helen in a house she owned in Schaumburg, Illinois.

Matlick told police later that Helen had stayed in Glenview that weekend preparing for her upcoming trip to Florida. But friends who dropped by to visit her were told she was unavailable, and Helen did not call anyone, which is uncharacteristic of her.

Matlick said he drove Helen to O'Hare at 7:00 a.m. on Monday without much luggage or a flight reservation; Helen normally traveled with lots of luggage and a carefully planned itinerary. She is also a late riser who would not normally fly out so early in the morning. There is no record of Helen flying out of O'Hare that day.

Matlick said Helen signed several checks totaling $15,000 before she left; many of the checks were to his benefit. When investigators determined the checks had not, in fact, been signed by Helen, Matlick changed his story and said he had signed the checks for her because she had injured her hand. Handwriting analysis experts do not believe he actually signed the checks, however, and the signatures were never tested against anyone else's writing.

Matlick's wife said he gave her a different story about Helen's disappearance; he said she did not return from the Mayo Clinic and he was waiting for her in Glenview. That weekend in Glenview, Matlick arranged to have carpeting replaced in one of the rooms of Helen's house, and had two rooms re-painted also. The workers who did the job did not notice anything out of the ordinary about the room. Matlick had the pink Cadillac he'd been driving cleaned and waxed, and the interior shampooed.

Matlick did not try to report Helen missing for over two weeks after her disappearance. The missing persons report had to come from a family member, so he contacted her brother, Charles Voorhees, in Ohio and notified him about his sister's disappearance.

After flying to Illinois and reporting Helen missing, Voorhees and Matlick searched her Glenview home for clues. Matlick destroyed her diaries, which she had written in every day for years. Voorhees says Helen left explicit instructions that they should be burned if anything happened to her, so he allowed Matlick to burn the papers outside of his presence.

Authorities' initial suspect in Helen's disappearance was Matlick. No ransom demand had been made for Helen and investigators did not think Matlick's story was credible. He took a series of lie detector tests but the results were inconclusive.

John Cadwallader Menk, an attorney, was appointed to look after Brach's estate in her absence. He was not permitted to see her will but Matlick told him she had willed all her money to various charities and to Voorhees. Menk tried to question Richard Bailey, whom Brach had been dating at the time of her disappearance and was supposed to meet her when she flew to Florida, but Bailey hired an attorney and refused to cooperate with Menk. He would not even admit he knew Brach.

A photograph of Bailey is posted with this case summary. He was active in the city's horse market; he was the owner of Bailey Stables and Country Club Stables. Bailey had a reputation as a con artist around Chicago; he would romance recently divorced or widowed middle-aged wealthy women, then fleece them out of their money through bad investments in horses.

Bailey had introduced Helen to the horse business; her accountant estimated that she had spent $250,000 on horses. Bailey and his brother had sold Helen some horses for much more than they were worth.

Helen was declared legally dead in 1984 and her brother and some animal protection organizations got most of her money. Helen's case remained open but inactive until 1989, when a prosecutor investigating horse fraud took a closer look at her disappearance. It was revealed that Bailey had connections to Silas Jayne, the founder of the Jayne Gang, which was involved in the horse business and in organized crime.

Silas is a possible suspect in the 1966 disappearances of Renee Bruhl, Patricia Blough and Ann Miller, who vanished together from Indiana Dunes State Park in Indiana. They rode their horses at one of Silas's stables. Silas had an established reputation as a vicious, cold-blooded gangster and many feared him. Police believe he and Richard Bailey were involved in Helen's apparent abduction. They theorize that Helen realized Bailey had scammed her and was planning to tell authorities and have him jailed, and he conspired with others and had her killed to silence her.

In 1994, Bailey was charged with numerous counts of fraud and with conspiring to commit murder, soliciting to commit murder, and causing the murder of Helen. Bailey pleaded guilty to racketeering, conspiracy, mail and wire fraud and money-laundering and admitted to conning elderly widows and divorcees. He denied scamming Helen, however, or having anything to do with his disappearance. before a federal judge.

After hearing the evidence against him in Helen's case, a federal judge decided Bailey had conspired to kill her and sentenced him to life in prison. The sentence was later reduced to 30 years. Bailey is not believed to have acted alone in Helen's case, but no one else was ever charged in connection with her disappearance. If it were not for the Brach allegations, he would have been sentenced to only about 11 years in prison.

In 2005, investigators announced that an individual, later identified as Joe Plemmons, had come forward with information about Helen's alleged murder. Plemmons, a horseman who had known Helen, confessed that he and ten others, including a police officer, beat and shot her to death at the behest of Silas Jayne and his nephew, Frank Jayne Jr., and incinerated her body at a steel mill off of Interstate 65 near Gary, Indiana.

Plemmons admitted to being the shooter after signing an agreement granting him immunity from prosecution. He said Helen was murdered to keep her from going to the police about being swindled in bad horse deals. He also stated that Bailey had nothing to do with the murder.

He named nine of the conspirators; the tenth, a woman, he did not identify because he says he never knew her name. Plemmons stated that the female conspirator impersonated Helen and used her plane ticket home from the Mayo Clinic, and that Helen herself was actually driven home.

Police are searching for corroboration to support Plemmons's confession; as of yet there is not enough evidence available to charge his alleged accomplices with anything relating to Helen's case. Silas Jayne died in 1987 and Frank is serving a prison sentence in Illinois for arson; he denies involvement in Helen's disappearance, as do all the other alleged conspirators who are still living.

Plemmons has given multiple contradictory accounts of his involvement in Helen's death and is an admitted lifelong con man, but his testimony had previously helped put a man in prison for murder. He testified against Kenneth Hansen at Hansen's 1994 trial for the 1955 murders of three young boys. (Hansen is one of those implicated by Plemmons in Helen's murder. He died in prison in 2007.) Plemmons told investigators that he finally confessed to his involvement in Helen's death because he could not bear the guilt anymore.

One piece of evidence which may support Plemmons's testimony is a ruby ring, which he says fell off of Brach's finger while he was disposing of her body. He kept the ring and later turned it over to the authorities. Brach's friends and family identified it as hers, but authorities haven't been able to prove this through DNA testing. A photo of the ring is posted with this case summary.

Bailey sought a new sentencing hearing as a result of Plemmons's testimony, arguing that the evidence proved he was innocent of involvement in Helen's disappearance and should therefore be released from prison. The court ruled against him in 2005, however, stating that the evidence would be more appropriate to overturn his conviction than reduce his sentence, and in any case it did not prove he was not complicit in Helen's murder.

Matlick died in a Pennsylvania nursing home in February 2011, at the age of 79. Plemmons lives in Florida. Bailey was released from prison in 2019, at the age of 90.

An unknown individual picked her up at 6:15 p.m. She left without saying anything to her parents has never been heard from again.

Andersen was a regular patron of the Cardinal Bar in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the time of her disappearance. She left behind personal belongings including her medication, vehicle, clothing and toothbrush. She did take her car keys and checkbook, but she hasn't used her checking account since her disappearance.

Andersen's parents were not initially concerned when she didn't come home that night because she would sometimes spend the night at a friend's house. They reported her missing on November 16, after she missed work at her job at Fabri-Tek Inc.

Andersen maintained a vegetarian diet in 1981. Her interests include motorcycles, yoga, pool and rock music. She had been living on her own for two years, but moved back in with her parents a few weeks before she disappeared. She was planning to move to the Austin, Texas area in April 1982 to live with her sister.

Andersen didn't like office work and was thinking of becoming an auto mechanic or a truck driver. Her family stated she didn't give any indication that there were problems in her life prior to her disappearance, and wasn't dating anyone seriously.

In 2002, police searched the vacant home of one of Andersen's former boyfriends, looking for evidence in connection with her disappearance. No significant evidence was recovered.

Brown was born and raised in Russia and moved to the United States approximately eight years before her disappearance.

On the day she went missing, she found out she had been named employee of the month at work. She and her mother and stepfather went out to eat at the Taco John's restaurant that evening to celebrate the honor.

After dinner, between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m., Anderson's mother and stepfather picked up some movies for her to watch, then dropped her off at her apartment at Greenwood Apartments.

It has been established that Anderson got safely inside her apartment that evening. She had been carrying a cup full of soda when her parents dropped her off. The empty cup was found in her apartment, and one of the videos she had gotten to watch was found in her VCR.

Anderson did not show up for her morning work shift, which is uncharacteristic of her, as she was exemplary employee. She has never been heard from again. Nothing appeared to be amiss in Anderson's apartment and the only thing missing was her keys.

The apartment door was locked from the outside. The building itself had a security door, but the door had been propped open that night by other tenants who were moving in.

On the night of Anderson's disappearance, there was a fire burning in a swamp on the outskirts of Wadena. She would have been able to view the fire from her window. Authorities theorized she left home to look at the fire up close, and someone attacked her. There is no evidence to support this theory, however.

That same evening, a brown Plymouth Horizon was stolen a couple of blocks from Anderson's apartment building and was never recovered. It is unknown whether the stolen car has any connection to her case.

Anderson's loved ones stated local people sometimes harassed her or attempted to take advantage of her. Although she's mildly mentally disabled, she tried to lead as normal a life as possible and was proud of being independent and having a job and her own home. She also had a boyfriend who lived in Lake Park, Illinois.

Suspected serial killer Floyd Todd Tapson was considered a possible suspect in Anderson's disappearance for a time, but he was cleared from that case after being interviewed by investigators. He is still a suspect in the disappearance of Kristi Nikle, a mentally disabled teenager who disappeared from Grand Forks, North Dakota in 1996.

All the members of Anderson's family have been ruled out as suspects in her case, as was her boyfriend. Her parents both died in 2008.

Toni Ann Bachman,"April 25, 1997","White Bear Lake Township, Minnesota",38,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",250 lbs,"Toni resided in White Bear Lake Township, Minnesota in 1997. She lived with her husband of ten years, Norman Allen Bachman Jr., and his three sons from a prior marriage, aged between ten and thirteen. Toni was employed in the human resources department at Hamline University at the time.

She was last seen at her family's residence in the 1700 block of Stillwater Street on Wednesday, April 25, 1997. At that time she sent messages to friends over the internet, saying her husband was threatening her. In the last message, she said he was looking over her shoulder as she typed and she had to go. No one besides Norman and his children reported seeing or hearing from her after that time.

Norman initially stated they had a fight and she locked herself in the bedroom and he didn't see her for the rest of the weekend. He said she had disappeared by the time he returned home from a trip to the store on Sunday.

Norman later changed his story slightly and said he and Toni had gone to the drugstore together on Sunday and after they got home, she told him to take his children to the grocery store. When he returned from that trip, she was gone, leaving a goodbye note. She called him from a blocked number on April 28, he said,

A week after he gave this version of events, Norman altered his story again and said Toni had disappeared over Sunday night and he assumed she'd gone to work on Monday and didn't find out otherwise until he called her workplace and learned she hadn't showed up. She was reported missing by coworkers on May 12; Norman said he hadn't done it himself because he assumed she'd left him.

Norman allegedly gave authorities contradictory statements regarding his wife's whereabouts prior to her disappearance. Toni was involved in a long-distance relationship with a man she had met online, and she told friends she wanted to leave her husband. She asked him for a divorce earlier in 1997; Norman was apparently not pleased by her request. Their relationship was troubled and in 1987, she claimed he had choked her.

When Norman's sons were interviewed by police, they reported their father and stepmother argued on Friday, April 27, and they didn't see her leave her room on Saturday or Sunday. They also reported hearing her scream.

Norman was charged with misdemeanor assault against a girlfriend in August 1997, four months after Toni disappeared. The victim told authorities that Norman poked her in the chest and grabbed her around her throat. His young son witnessed the incident and called 911.

Norman pleaded guilty to the charges in November. He was arrested again in September 1998 after another girlfriend claimed he sexually assaulted her at knifepoint and threatened to kill her and himself. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in connection with the incident and had to register as a sex offender.

The Bachmans' residence was searched by authorities in May 1997, shortly after Toni vanished. There was a bloody sheet hidden between the mattress and the bedframe in the master bedroom. Bloodstains, human tissue and human fat were discovered on a box inside their basement freezer; authorities stated the evidence was consistent with blunt force trauma. DNA analysis proved that the blood and tissue were Toni's in September 1997.

Norman filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 1997, listing Toni's address as ""unknown"" on his forms. In 2000, Toni's mother sued Norman for at least $50,000 in damages for ""mental pain, discomfort and the loss of companionship"" caused by Toni's wrongful death. Her mother died in 2008. The case had been reopened in 2012; police searched the backyard of the Bachmans' former home and found ""significant information.""

Norman's youngest son, Frederick, was interviewed by authorities at this time and told them his father had admitted to killing Toni, but said no one would ever be able to prove it.

Frederick recalled that his father cleaned the basement with bleach after Toni was last seen, and that there was a funny smell in Norman's car immediately after Toni's disappearance. As an adult, Frederick worked at a funeral home, and he claimed he now recognized the smell as being consistent with a corpse.

In April 2015, Norman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter in Toni's presumed death. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. In October 2015, he confessed to killing her.

Norman stated he and Toni got into an argument, she hit him in the chest and he strangled her to death. He wrapped her body in a plastic tarp, stored it in his cellar for several days, then dismembered it. The parts were still in the basement when the police came to the house to ask where Toni was. The following night, he buried Toni's dismembered remains in three holes at a site a two-hour drive from his home.

Authorities have searched the spot Norman indicated five times, but have found nothing. He pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to thirteen and a half years in prison. If Toni's body is ever located, the sentence will be reduced to ten years.",http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1826dfmn.html,-93.020897,45.096549

She was driving her 1972 Ford Torino, which was painted red with a black vinyl top. She was accompanied by the restaurant's bartender, a drifter who called himself Mike Johnson. Johnson's real name is Darren Dee O'Neall. A photograph of O'Neall is posted with this case summary. Aughe has never been heard from again. Her car was found abandoned in Eugene, Oregon on May 2. O'Neall's fingerprints were inside.

When authorities searched Aughe's apartment after her disappearance, they found signs of a struggle, including pools of blood, semen stains and bloodsoaked bedsheets and linen. An all-points bulletin was issued for O'Neall. He had worked for the La Paloma Restaurant for only two days before he disappeared after emptying the cash register and stealing liquor. The United States Customs authorities reported photographing him driving across the border into Canada in Aughe's car. He was apparently alone in the vehicle at the time.

O'Neill was charged with the murder of another young woman, Robin Smith, who disappeared four weeks before Aughe did. Her body was found in May 1987. O'Neill was not arrested until September 1987. He pleaded guilty to Smith's murder in 1989 and was sentenced to life in prison. He was also convicted of second-degree auto theft for for stealing Aughe's car and for an unrelated kidnapping and rape. He is still incarcerated.

Aughe was a beauty school student and the mother of two young children in 1987. It's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. She has never been located and O'Neill hasn't been charged in her disappearance because of a lack of evidence, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/wendy-l-aughe,-122.479191,48.754208

She was employed as a waitress at the Hunter's Inn bar at the time. She had argued with her live-in boyfriend of two months, Michael John ""Cowboy Mike"" Braae, the day she went missing. A month after Ault vanished, some personal items of hers, including a credit card, were found near Castle Rock, Washington. There was no sign of Ault, however, and she has never been heard from again.

Ault's sister reported her missing. At first police believed she had merely gone off on a drug binge without telling anyone, but Braae is now the prime suspect in her disappearance. He is a suspected serial killer. In 2008, he was convicted in the 2001 rape and murder of a Lacey, Washington woman and sentenced to 48 years in prison. He had also been charged with attempted murder in the shooting of another woman, but the victim, who was brain-damaged in the attack, was unable to testify and the jury deadlocked at eleven to one for conviction.

Braae is also considered a suspect in the death of Velina Larson and the disappearance of Debra Vanluven. Larson, like Ault, had argued with Brae shortly before her disappearance, and VanLuven had dated him. Braae was ruled out as a suspect in the disappearance of Phyllis Lewellen. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

Ault's purse and credit cards were discovered shortly after she was last seen, at a rest stop off Interstate 5 near the Tuttle River and the town of Castle Rock. Nothing else was located, however.

Her parents were out and her grandparents were watching her and two of her siblings; a third child was in school. Sometime during the day, a fire broke out at the Jeannie house.

Jeannie's five-year-old brother stated that they were standing in the yard together watching the fire when a woman drove up in an expensive-looking car and urged him to get help. She directed him to a house down the road, although there was another residence close by.

When Jeannie's brother returned, both his sister and the unidentified woman were gone. Jeannie's grandmother, however, contradicted her grandson's version of events. She said she took Jeannie's brother and sister outside when the fire started, went into the house to find Jeannie and called for her several times without result.

Most authorities believe Jeannie died in the fire that consumed her house. Some possible bone fragments were sent to a state laboratory for analysis, but they were not identified as hers.

Jeannie's siblings believe she may have been hidden by other family members and is possibly still alive. They think Jeannie was possibly conceived out of wedlock and the fire was set as a diversion so someone could take Jeannie away from her home and to the care of her biological father.

It was at her siblings' request that authorities reopened the investigation into Jeannie's disappearance over fifty years after she vanished. A Minnesota woman had her DNA tested against the Bryant's family in 2006, but the results were not a match. Her case remains unsolved.

The couple had two children together and resided on Vine Street in Reedsburg, Wisconsin. Audrey was employed at the nearby woolen mill in the early 1960s.

Authorities said that Audrey and Ronald's marriage was troubled and there were allegations of abuse. Audrey filed a criminal complaint against her husband on July 4, 1962. She said that Ronald beat her shortly beforehand, resulting in head injuries. Audrey also stated that Ronald threatened to murder her. She claimed that he had two loaded firearms inside the trunk of his vehicle.

Audrey departed from her family's residence during the day on July 7, 1962, three days after she contacted authorities regarding Ronald's alleged behavior. She planned to retrieve her paycheck from the mill at the time. Audrey never returned home and has not been heard from again. Ronald phoned many of her loved ones after her disappearance and inquired as to her whereabouts. He maintained his innocence in his wife's case from the onset.

The couple's fourteen-year-old babysitter returned to Wisconsin shortly after Audrey disappeared. She claimed that she and Audrey hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin and then took a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana shortly after Audrey vanished.

After they left the bus, the girl decided to turn herself in as a runaway. She said she last saw Audrey walking around the corner away from the bus stop.

#MP19994 Dona Mae Bayerl,"May 6, 1979","Muskego, Wisconsin",38,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",130 lbs - 150 lbs,"DonaMae was last seen at her home on Fennimore Lane in Muskego, Wisconsin on May 6, 1979. Her husband, John H. Bayerl, stated they had an argument and she left in the family car to cool off. When she had not returned by 10:20 p.m., he went to bed.

About an hour later, John was awakened by the sound of a car pulling into the garage and a door slamming downstairs, and then the sound of someone moving around inside the house. He thought DonaMae had come home. He then heard a car turn around in the gravel lot across the street and drive slowly away.

When DonaMae didn't come to bed, John came downstairs to look for her and found the car in the garage. The garage door was open and the drift pin that normally held the door shut was missing and it has never been found. and the garage door open. There was no sign of DonaMae and her clothes were left behind. She has never been heard from again.

John reported her missing three days later. He told the police she had taken $200 in cash, that there were problems in their marriage, and that he wasn't concerned by her absence. However, DonaMae's family didn't believe she would have left on her own without the couple's two daughters, whom she was devoted to, and they reported their concerns to the police.

After DonaMae's disappearance, John behaved suspiciously: he refused to say what they had been arguing about that night and he did all the laundry, something he had never done before, even when DonaMae was too sick to do it herself. After he was done washing them, a quilt and a rug still had stains on them. John acted unconcerned about his wife and even went bowling right after her disappearance. He didn't even tell his coworkers DonaMae was missing, and he acted as if DonaMae wasn't going to come back.

He stated that on the day DonaMae went missing, the family had gone out shopping and to dinner, something the children contradicted. The couple's daughters said they hadn't gone shopping or had dinner out that day. They stated their parents had been fighting all day and that their mother had been sick. They had last seen her when she put them to bed.

DonaMae's sister came to stay at the house and take care of the children in her absence, and found bloodstains on the wall inside the garage and on a bottle inside the family vehicle. There was evidence of a struggle, including items knocked over. The police began to suspect foul play after the bloodstains were discovered. 1970s forensics didn't allow for DNA testing, but authorities determined the blood was DonaMae's type and not John's. He said didn't know how it got there.

Although DonaMae had been an independent person with a career, after she married John she became very dependent on him. She stopped working, and John didn't allow her to have much money. She had only one close friend, a woman who lived in Michigan. DonaMae wrote 35 to 40 letters a year to this woman.

In the letters, she confided that her husband physically abused her and that he had once thrown her down the basement stairs. DonaMae stated John had asked her to sign a document promising that he would become the sole owner of their house if she died, but she refused to sign it. Her friend offered her $500 in cash if she wanted to leave her husband.

John admitted that he had struck DonaMae on multiple occasions, and that he had been having an affair for two years prior to her disappearance. He had also abused his first wife, who divorced him on grounds of ""cruel and inhuman treatment"" after two years of marriage.

Three months after DonaMae was last seen, John filed for divorce. He subsequently remarried and went on to abuse other women he had relationships with. In interviews with police, he said he thought something bad must have happened to DonaMae because she would not have abandoned her children, and he admitted he had been a bad husband.

A photo of John is posted with this case summary. In February 2019, he was arrested in Florida, where he lived at the time, and charged with first-degree murder in DonaMae's case.

The case was mainly a circumstantial one, and one of the key pieces of evidence was a recorded phone conversation John had with his and DonaMae's youngest daughter in 2009. John stated: ""Something happened and I, it, I, IÕm sure that her heartÕs not beating. Because if it was, she would have found her way back, whatever. You know what I mean? I donÕt think sheÕs alive.""

At John's trial in June 2019, he did not testify and the defense did not present any evidence, and instead simply argued that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. After more than five hours of deliberation, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder. John faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison.

Bertolas' boyfriend, who worked the 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. shift, called in sick the day of her disappearance. He later admitted he called her at least twice that day. Bertolas told people he had ""begged"" to see her, and when she said she couldn't afford the gas, he offered to pay for it. She finally agreed to meet him.

Bertolas has never been seen again. Her white car, which was her prized possession, was found abandoned in the parking lot of Red Carpet Lanes on April 27. No evidence as to her fate was located inside the car.

Dogs tracked Bertolas' scent to the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Milwaukee. Authorities later learned the cemetery caretaker was Bertolas' boyfriend's father, and that the boyfriend had also worked there before. A napkin was found in Bertolas' room with the address of the cemetery written on it.

There was a dark-colored pickup truck driving behind the bus, and when she got out it pulled up next to her and she spoke to the driver, then got inside the vehicle. The truck backed out of Sara's driveway and started off in the direction of the nearby town of Trego. Sara has never been heard from again.

Authorities initially classified Sara as a runaway, but now they are unsure what caused her disappearance. She didn't take any clothing or money with her, and she wasn't behaving in an unusual manner before her disappearance. She had recently broken up with her 21-year-old boyfriend because her parents had forbidden her to see him.

Sara and her ex-boyfriend did have lunch together on the day of her disappearance and he drove her back to school for her afternoon classes. He said this was the last time he saw her. Sara's family believes she was harmed by someone she knew, as they don't think she would have gotten into a stranger's vehicle.

There's speculation that Crystal Soulier's death may be connected to Sara's disappearance. Soulier, who was eighteen years old, disappeared from Cable, Wisconsin in October 1996. Five months later her body was found in Rock County, Wisconsin, but it wasn't identified until 2002. Her murder remains unsolved.

Soulier and Sara were both blonde young women in the same age group. They knew each other and they also had at least 19 mutual friends, all of them young men in their twenties. Both Soulier and Sara attended parties held by these men, and Sara's school friends were unaware of this. None of the men have been named as suspects in Sara's disappearance or Soulier's murder, which is also unsolved.

Sara's parents divorced when she was a toddler. She lived with her mother and stepfather at the time of her disappearance, but she visited her father and stepmother's home in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin on a regular basis, and she was thinking of moving in with them.

Sara was a sophomore at Spooner High School in 1996. Her father believes she is deceased.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/4441?nav;Êhttp://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1618dfwi.html;Êhttps://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/4441?nav

Shirley Theresa Moon Atwood,"July 15, 2006","Canaan, Maine",35,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",105 lbs,"Shirley was reported missing in on July 15, 2006. She has never been heard from again. Her vehicle was found abandoned after her disappearance. Shirley was estranged from her husband, Shannon Roy Atwood, at the time of her disappearance, and had moved out of their home on Route 23 in Canaan, Maine. Shannon was still living in the home with another woman, Cheryl Murdoch.

Photograph of Shannon and Murdoch are posted with this case summary. Murdoch disappeared on July 27, twelve days after Shirley. Her body was found in a wooded area off Scott Road in Canaan on August 11. She had been murdered.

When authorities went to Shannon's home to question him about Murdoch's case and search his property, he barricaded himself inside, threatened the officers with a bow and arrow and threatened to blow the house up. They arrested him for criminal threatening, reckless conduct and terrorizing. He was sentenced to nine months in jail.

In February 2007, shortly before he was scheduled to be released from jail, Shannon was additionally charged with both Murdoch and Shirley's murders. Authorities believe Shirley was murdered sometime between March 15 and July 15, 2006.

Shannon has a criminal history for burglary and theft, and was also convicted of aggravated assault on a previous girlfriend. The girlfriend stated he attacked her and threatened to murder her and bury her body in an isolated field.

Authorities wanted to try Shannon for both women's murders at the same time, but a judge ruled there had to be two separate trials. In November 2007, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against Shannon in Shirley's presumed death. They stated there was insufficient evidence to proceed to trial. The charge could be refiled at a later date, however.

In July 2008, Shannon was convicted of Murdoch's murder in a bench trial. He was sentenced to 55 years to life in prison.

Shirley was having financial problems at the time of her disappearance. She had inherited a sizable amount of money and property from her grandfather when she was a teenager, including her Route 23 residence, but in 2006 the government placed a lien on the residence for back taxes. Authorities never believed she left voluntarily as a result of the lien, however.

She was in the process of moving from a residence on Bates Street in Lewiston, Maine to an apartment on Vernon Street in Bethel at the time of her disappearance. She has never been heard from again. Her vehicle, a green 2004 Subaru Forester, was wrecked before her disappearance and undriveable, but she apparently took the car's vanity license plate, which reads reading ""SASSYFJ."" Johnson apparently left her dog, Sassy, behind at the Bethel residence, which is uncharacteristic of her. Five days later, her landlord contacted an animal control officer, who removed Sassy from the home. It was only then that Johnson's disappearance was reported to the police. Her cellular phone has been turned off and there's no money left in her bank account. There were possible sightings of her in the local area after her disappearance; witnesses said she was acting confused. Although foul play is not suspected in Johnson's case, because of her medical conditions, she is considered to be in danger. It's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.

She had lived with her husband in a residence off Clark Street, overlooking Harris Cove, for about two years, and she was a member of the local Catholic church. Her husband had told her family Lehan had gone to a Catholic retreat in Montana. It wasn't uncommon for her to go a long time without getting in touch with her family, and they didn't report her missing until the summer of 2013. They had last visited her in July 2002. Authorities launched an extensive search of the fourteen acres behind Lehan's former home, using cadaver dogs, but the search turned up nothing of interest.

Ayla Bell Reynolds,"December 16, 2011","Waterville, ME",1,White,"2'9""",30 lbs,"Ayla was last seen when her father, Justin DiPietro, put her to bed at her home on Violette Avenue in Waterville, Maine at 8:00 p.m. on December 16, 2011. She apparently vanished during the night and has never been seen again. Her father called the police at 8:50 the next morning. DiPietro, his sister, his girlfriend and the women's two children were at the residence all night the night Ayla disappeared. Authorities maintain the baby's father has not been cooperative with the investigation and they believe the adults who were in the home that night are withholding information. Investigators found Ayla's blood in the basement of DiPietro's home, which is where he slept that night with his girlfriend and her child. His sister and his sister's child slept on the first floor, as did Ayla. DiPietro maintains his innocence and says he has no idea where his daughter is. The child's mother, Trista Reynolds, was in a ten-day substance abuse treatment program when her daughter disappeared. The day before Ayla disappeared, Trista had filed for sole custody. In October, two months before her disappearance, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) removed Ayla from Trista's home and placed her with her father. DiPietro did not know about Trista's custody bid. She has filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming the DHHS was negligent and the child's disappearance could have been prevented. Photos of Trista and DiPietro are posted below this case summary. In April 2012, police found some unspecified items of interest behind the Hathaway Creative Center in the Kennebec River, about a mile from DiPietro's home. May 2012, nearly six months after Ayla vanished, authorities publicly stated they believed she was dead, but did not believe she had been abducted.

Tevanian apparently walked out of her home during the early morning hours, sometime before 7:00 a.m. She took only a paper bag containing toothpaste, dental floss and a toothbrush. Although she had a history of leaving home and would be found wandering around town, her March 1996 disappearance was the first time she'd left the house in months.

A neighbor saw Tammy cross Court Street at approximately 8:00 a.m. but she never arrived at school. Tammy has not been seen again. She was was not reported as a missing child to law enforcement until after the school day ended, as Lincoln Street School did not verify students' absences until after Tammy's disappearance. Extensive searches of the area produced little evidence as to Tammy's whereabouts. Police recieved a tip that she may be buried in Exeter Cemetery, in a grave dug in 1984. They dug up the grave and found only the 91-year-old woman who was supposed to be there They drained and searched a pond in 1996 and found nothing relating to Tammy's case. Victor George Wonyetye Jr. was named as a suspect in Tammy's case shortly after she disappeared. Wonyetye was employed at Brad's Custom Auto Body on Main Street in Exeter in 1984, which was located several blocks from where Tammy was last seen. Police found a photograph of Tammy in his house as well. A photo of Wonyetye is posted below this case summary. He has a criminal record dating back to the 1960s and has been periodically imprisoned for forced entry, larceny and sexual assaults throughout the years. He is also considered a suspect in the 1984 Florida disappearance of Marjorie Luna. Wonyetye lived near Marjorie's residence at the time she vanished and her case remains unsolved as well. Wonteye was incarcerated for burglary in Florida in 1992. He was never charged in connection with either Tammy or Luna's cases and there was no physical evidence linking him to either of the girls' abductions. He died in prison in 2012. Tammy remains missing and her case is unsolved.

Kenneth said they were watching television that evening and he fell up at 11:30 p.m. When he woke up, Dorothy was gone. He reported her missing at 4:13 a.m. the next day. She has never been heard from again. Dorothy left behind all her belongings, except her pocketbook and a white flowered beaded change purse. Her mother stated she would have contacted her family if she'd left on her own, but none of her relatives have heard from her since 1973. Dorothy was reportedly under great stress at the time of her disappearance due to health problems with her child. She told her mother she was afraid for her life. Kenneth had filed for divorce the month before she vanished, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was granted after Dorothy's disappearance and he remarried in 1974. He is now divorced from his second wife. Dorothy dropped out of high school in her sophomore year after she became pregnant. Her son was living with her mother when Dorothy disappeared. Police reopened the investigation into her disappearance in 2007. Her parents are deceased and the whereabouts of her son are unknown.

Rachael Elizabeth Garden,22-Mar-80,"Newton, New Hampshire",15,Caucasian,5'1,100 lbs,"Rachael purchased a pack of cigarettes and chewing gum at Rowe's Corner Market on Route 108 in Newton, New Hampshire on March 22, 1980. She paid with a $5 bill, received her change and departed from the store between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. and began walking to a friend's house in the 50 block of north Main Street where she planned to spend the night. Rachael never arrived as scheduled and has not been heard from again. Her parents reported her as a missing person at 10:00 a.m. the day after she was last seen. An extensive search of the area produced no clues as to Rachael's whereabouts. She left all of her belongings behind at her family's residence, including her dental retainer. Rachael owned a horse and her family members said it was uncharacteristic of her to leave the animal unattended. On the night of her disappearance, Rachael was seen talking to three male acquaintances in a dark-colored car near Rowe's Market. The men all had troubled reputations and were involved in criminal activity; one of them later served a prison term for assault and rape. After Rachael's disappearance, one of the men allegedly confessed to killing her. The reported confession caused police to dig up a site off Route 108 to look for Rachael's remains, but no evidence was located. It is unknown whether any of the men were actually involved in Rachael's case. Rachael is the oldest of four children. She was a freshman at Sanborn Regional High School in 1980. Her loved ones describe her as outspoken, fun-loving, friendly and occasionally rebellious. She had a good relationship with her siblings, but sometimes resented having to babysit them. She complained to friends about her parents' rules, and sometimes skipped school to smoke and drink alcohol with other teenagers in the woods near Maple Avenue. Because of her age at the time of her disappearance, Rachael was originally thought to be a runaway. Although a voluntary disappearance is still considered a possibility, investigators are now investigating other theories as well, including the possibility of foul play. Rachael's case is classified as a non-family abduction due to the lack of available evidence. While there is no evidence that the two cases are connected, it is worth noting that Laureen Rahn, another petite brunette about the same age as Rachael, disappeared from a nearby town just a month after Rachael did and was never found. Laureen's case remains unsolved as well and is also classified as a non-family abduction.Ê

She was last seen at the Safeway store on Brooklyn Avenue northeast in the University District between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. She bought orange juice, trash bags, Tylenol and over-the-counter sleeping medication, left the store and has never been heard from again.

The last activity on her cellular phone was when a text message was sent to her at 2:45 p.m. The phone pinged off a tower at 47th Avenue Northeast at the time. After that the phone was turned off; it has never been recovered.

It's uncharacteristic of her to leave of Perez own accord, and she didn't leave behind a note. Her parents live in New Jersey; she is an only child and was close to them. She lived with her aunt and uncle at the time of her disappearance; she'd moved in with them when she enrolled in college.

Perez had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was distressed about it, and a private investigator hired by her family believes she took her own life, but her parents said she seemed happy in the days prior to her disappearance and they don't believe she was suicidal.

They were last seen by their respective co-workers when they left work at 5:00 p.m. on June 8, 2011. Both of them apparently made it to their home on Colbert Street, but neither of them showed up for work the next day, which is uncharacteristic of them. They have never been heard from again.

When police went to the residence, they found all the doors locked. However, a window in an interior door connecting the house to the garage was newly broken and the home's phone line had been cut.

The Curriers' dark green 1996 Saturn SL2 sedan with the Vermont license plate number ABF-818 was missing, as was a snub-nosed Ruger .38 handgun Lorraine had recently purchased. A photo of the sedan is posted with this case summary. Lorraine's two pairs of eyeglasses and her contact lenses were left behind, but her purse and wallet were missing.

Two days after the Curriers went missing, their car was found abandoned at a parking lot in the 200 block of Pearl Street in Essex Junction, next to a dumpster between two apartment buildings. This is less than a mile from William and Lorraine's home, and a short walk from the bus stop.

Investigators released a sketch of an unidentified man whom a witness may have seen driving the car; the drawing is posted with this case summary.

In July 2012, authorities announced they believe the Curriers had been murdered and they had a suspect, Israel Keyes. He owned a run-down rural cabin in Constable, New York, a town not far from Essex. He checked into an Essex hotel the day before the Curriers vanished, then checked out the day after.

Investigators believe Keyes broke into their home, abducted William and Lorraine and murdered them shortly thereafter. They stated it was a random crime and the couple was not targeted.

A photo of Keyes is posted with this case summary. He is presently in jail in Alaska, awaiting trial for the kidnap and murder of a teenage girl. After his arrest, he confessed to the Curriers' murders and told police where to find their bodies.

William worked an animal care technician for the University of Vermont at the time of his disappearance, and Lorraine worked in the financial services department at Fletcher Allen Health Care, the university's health care center. They have siblings living in Vermont, but no children.

The Curriers haven't used their cellular phones or bank accounts since they went missing, and all their medication was left behind at home. Their bodies have not been located, but foul play is suspected in their cases due to the circumstances involved.

Iris Leslie Brown,"March 15, 1976","Burlington, Vermont",27,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",127 lbs,"Brown was last seen leaving her Burlington, Vermont apartment on March 15, 1976. She was accompanied by William John Posey Jr. at the time. Posey was supposed to drive her to Connecticut to visit her boyfriend, Martin Gold. He was incarcerated on drug charges and Posey told Brown he was about to be released early.

Brown never arrived to see Gold and has never been heard from again. When questioned about her disappearance, Posey initially said he had driven Brown partway to Connecticut, but he left her in Springfield, Massachusetts after they found out Gold was not going to be released from prison after all.

Authorities believed Brown had been murdered, and Posey has always been the prime suspect in her disappearance and presumed death. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. Blood matching Brown's type was found on the seat and floor of his car. He was convicted of kidnapping in her case in 1981 and sentenced to life in prison, but was not charged with murder, as her body has never been located.

Posey pleaded guilty to the abduction and murder of an Illinois woman in 1980 and is currently incarcerated in a North Carolina prison. He was considered a possible suspect in the 1978 disappearance of Judy Martins from Kent, Ohio. Posey lived in Kent at the time Martins disappeared. He was using the name John T. Scorpione at the time. She has never been located and her case remains unsolved.

In 2008, Posey confessed to causing Brown's death after investigators promised him he would not face charges in connection with it. He said he never intended to take Brown to her boyfriend and only promised he would as a way of luring her into his car. He stated they never got much farther than Barre, Vermont.

Posey tried to convince Brown to help him sell cocaine and when she refused, they got into an argument and he strangled her near the Shelburne Museum. He stated he dropped her body over a guardrail on Interstate 89 in Vermont, but couldn't remember exactly where. Brown's family accepted Posey's story and said they would hold a memorial service for her.

Brown grew up in Enosberg Falls, Vermont. She graduated from Enosburg Falls High School and the University of Vermont. Investigators plan to renew the search for her remains.",http://charleyproject.org/case/iris-leslie-brown,-73.173408,44.484504
Lynne Kathryn Schulze,"December 10, 1971","Middlebury, VT",18,White/Caucasian,"5'3""",105-125 lbs,"Schulze was last seen leaving her dormitory on the Middlebury College campus in Middlebury, Vermont on December 10, 1971, the first day of final exams before Christmas break started. Schulze apparently stopped at a local health food store, All the Good Things, and bought dried prunes, and was seen eating them outside the store at 12:30 p.m. She said she was going to take a bus to New York, but the bus had already left. Schulze returned to campus and was seen in her dormitory. She left her room at 12:55 p.m. She was on her way with her friends to take a final exam in her English Drama class when she said she had forgotten her favorite pen and was going to go back to get it. The exam was scheduled for 1:00 p.m.; she never showed up.
At 2:15 p.m., Schulze was seen standing on Court Street, across the street from All the Good Things and the bus stop where she'd been earlier. This is the last time anyone ever saw or heard from her. She left her identification, checkbook and all her personal belongings behind when she vanished. She may have been carrying $30 in cash with her. Campus security was alerted to Schulze's disappearance two days after she was last seen, but her parents were not notified for a week.
Schulze had mentioned the idea of faking her own death and starting life anew prior to her disappearance, but her friends did not take her seriously. In the letters she wrote frequently to family and friends back home, she admitted she felt homesick and had considered withdrawing from school, but she never indicated she was planning on dropping out of sight or leaving college before the term was over, and she did register for spring semester classes. Her relatives don't believe she was unusually distressed. She took her English Drama class seriously, had perfect attendance and studied hard for the final exam she never attended. Although her academic performance at Middlebury wasn't as good as it had been in high school, she wasn't failing any classes.
There were several possible sightings of Schulze after her disappearance, but none of them were confirmed. Several people made confessions of involvement in her case, but all of their statements turned out to be false. Little evidence is available as to her fate, but Schulze's disappearance is considered suspicious and her family believes she died shortly after her disappearance. She was a freshman at Middlebury in 1971, and lived in Simsbury, Connecticut when she was not at college. Schulze enjoyed writing at the time of her disappearance and had kept a journal during her senior year of high school.
In 2015, authorities announced they were looking at Robert Durst as a possible suspect in Schulze's disappearance. He and his wife, Kathleen, owned All the Good Things in 1971. Kathleen Durst disappeared from New York City in 1982, and Robert is considered the prime suspect in her case, but he has never faced charges connected to it. A photo of him is posted below this case summary. Investigators have ruled him out as a suspect in the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modaferri from San Francisco, California, but he's being considered in the disappearance of Karen Mitchell from Eureka, California that same year. Robert was charged with the 2001 Texas homicide of Morris Black. He claimed he murdered Black in self-defense, and was acquitted in 2003. In 2015, he was charged with murder in the 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman.
Both of Schulze's parents died in the 1990s, but her sister is still alive and hopes for a resolution in her disappearance. Her case is unsolved.
Some agencies give the date of Schulze's disappearance as December 11, 1971. http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/s/schulze_lynne.html

Welden left campus shortly after 2:30 p.m. She was probably carrying little or no money at the time, and she left behind an uncashed check her parents had sent her for living expenses. She was also under-dressed for the cold weather.
Welden was hitchhiking near the Bennington campus when a passing motorist picked her up at 2:45 p.m. She told him she was going to hike on the Long Trail off Route 9, near Glastenbury Mountain. The driver dropped her off on Route 9, about three miles from her destination. Several others saw her at that day walking on the trail. The last confirmed sighting of Welden was at 4:00 p.m., when she spoke to a man on the trail and asked her how far it extended. He told her it went all the way to Canada. The sun set at about 5:00 p.m. and it began snowing a few hours after that, accumulating three inches.
Welden has never been heard from again. Her roommate became concerned the next morning when she realized she'd never returned home the previous night. Later that morning, she notified the school authorities of Welden's disappearance. At the time, Bennington students were required to sign themselves out if they planned to stay out past 11:00 p.m., then check in with the school security officer upon their return; Welden had done neither of those things. When she failed to attend her classes the following Monday, Bennington College officials notified her family and the police.
An extensive search of the Long Trail and its environs turned up no sign of Welden and no significant clues. The search was hampered by the fact that Vermont had no state police at the time. Eventually, officials from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York stepped in to help. Investigators initially believed Welden had gotten lost in the mountains and died of exposure, but as time passed without their finding any sign of her they began to consider other theories.
Authorities looked into Welden's background to see if she might have left of her own accord. She had never had a steady boyfriend and she was a good student, majoring in art, but she had lately become less interested in the subject. She found herself drawn to music and botany instead and may have been thinking of changing her major. Although there were reports that she was somewhat depressed at the time of her disappearance, her family and friends said she only had normal problems for a girl her age and was not unhappy enough to commit suicide or run away from home. She left all her belongings behind, and her family stated she was not the type of person to leave without warning. There is no hard evidence of foul play in Welden's disappearance, but many people believe she was murdered and buried somewhere in near the Long Trail.
Welden lived with her parents and three younger sisters in Stamford, Connecticut when she was not in school. She enjoyed painting in oils and watercolors, pencil and charcoal sketching, and playing the guitar, and she was physically active and an experienced hiker and camper. In part because of her father's lobbying, in July 1947 Vermont passed a law creating a state police force. Welden's disappearance remains unsolved; there has been no indication of her whereabouts since 1946.Ê","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/40143

Mary Agnes Moroney,"May 15, 1930","Chicago, IL",2,White,"3'0""",20 lbs,"Mary Agnes Moroney disappeared from her home on May 15, 1930. An ad had been placed in a Chicago newspaper asking for help for the Moroney family. A woman who gave the name of Mrs. Julia Otis responded to the ad claiming to be a social worker. She first appeared on May 14, 1930 and spent time with Mary's mother and sister. The next day Julia Otis again came to the house, bringing gifts and money for the family. Julia asked if she could take Mary shopping for new clothes and shoes. Julia Otis then took Mary down the street and she was never seen again.

The next day the Moroneys got a letter from Julia Otis saying she was taking Mary to California and would bring her back in two months time. Two weeks later, another letter was received from a woman named Alice Henderson. The letter stated that Julia Otis was her cousin and the reason she had taken Mary was because Julia's husband and daughter had died the year before. Mrs. Henderson wrote that Julia Otis would bring Mary back soon. Julia otis was described as being around 22 years old and well dressed with a cultured voice. She had protuding teeth. She claimed that a social service worker named Mrs. Henderson had sent her.

Although no specific detective is assigned to the case, it is still considered to be open.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/14705

Marcy Jo Andrews,"February 14, 1984","Chicago, Illinois",24,Caucasian / White,"5'1"" - 5'2""
",120 lbs,"Andrews was last seen in Chicago, Illinois on February 14, 1984. She and two female friends went to a party at Casey Nowicki's apartment in the 2500 block of west Iowa Street. Andrews and Nowicki had never met before. The women and Nowicki smoked marijuana and Andrews drank some beer.

Later that day, Nowicki was driving the women home when he ran his Volkswagen Rabbit into a concrete viaduct. He wasn't hurt and neither were Andrews's friends, but Andrews's ankle was injured; she couldn't stand on it and it appeared to be broken. Nowicki gave his car keys and some money to the other women and told them to get his car towed while he took Andrews to the hospital. He wanted to get away from the scene before the police arrived because he was uninsured.

Andrews's companions made several calls to Nowicki's apartment that night, but were only able to speak to Andrews once. She sounded confused and her speech was slurred, as if she had been drugged. Andrews stated Nowicki had not taken her to the hospital. She said she was frightened of him and wanted to go home, and asked her friends for help.

The two women went to the apartment to return Nowicki's car keys and pick up Andrews, but were not allowed inside. They came back repeatedly over the next few days and asked to be allowed inside the apartment, saying they wouldn't return his keys until they were allowed to see Andrews. Nowicki wouldn't let them in, said Andrews had left on her own, and eventually threatened to kill them if they didn't give his keys back, which they finally did. He did let other individuals come in and out of the apartment.

Andrews left almost all her belongings behind at home, including clothing, jewelry and her reading glasses. She never picked up her last paycheck from work and she had $91 in her bank account that was left untouched following her disappearance. She had little contact with her biological father, who was not a part of her life when she was growing up; she only contacted him in 1983.She was, however, close to her mother, stepfather and other relatives. Her mother stated she always let her family and friends know where she was at, even when she was traveling. After her February 1984 disappearance, none of them ever saw or heard from her again.

At the time of her disappearance, Andrews was living with her step-grandmother in northwest Chicago. Her mother stated she began using drugs at the age of twelve, and later dropped out of high school. In 1982, she admitted she had a substance abuse problem and spent nine months in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. While in the program, she started therapy, got her GED and began attending classes at Daley Junior Community College.

She transferred to Northeastern Illinois University after she finished the alcohol treatment program, and got a job at a publishing company. She had been continuously employed since the age of sixteen. By the time of her disappearance, she had decided to move to Paducah, Kentucky, near where her aunt lived. She had secured another job there, was in the process of packing and planned to start the summer term at Paducah Community College on June 1.

Nowicki was charged with Andrews's murder in 2000, and was tried in 2005. He has an extensive criminal history, including convictions for burglary and armed robbery. Prosecutors stated Nowicki was a drug dealer in 1984 and, instead of taking Andrews to the hospital to be treated for her car accident injuries, he took her back to his apartment and had her take THC until she was incoherent.

One Nowicki's friends, Michael John Panisi, testified he saw Andrews naked and handcuffed to a radiator inside the apartment a few days after February 14. Andrews appeared to be under the influence of drugs, and Nowicki said she had taken THC and was ""too screwed up to be walking around the apartment."" Other witnesses also saw Andrews in the apartment during that time period, naked and apparently drugged.

Panisi stated he unchained Andrews and gave her some food, and he and Nowicki were able to dress her. He then bought some drugs from Nowicki and left. When he returned the next day, Andrews was still there and still appeared to be under the influence, disoriented and unaware of her surroundings, and while he was there, another man who had come to the apartment to buy drugs sexually assaulted her.

Nowicki told Panisi he had tricked Andrews into taking an overdose of THC. Panisi stated he came back the day after that and found Andrews was lying dead on the floor, wrapped up in blanket or rug, and Nowicki stated she had ""died on me.""

Nowicki refused to call the police and asked Panisi to help him dispose of Andrews's body. When Panisi said no, Nowicki told him not to ever come back to the apartment. Nowicki then carried the body downstairs by himself, put it in the trunk of his mother's brown 1974 Maverick, and drove away.

Another witness, who had known Andrews for several years, backed up Panisi's testimony and said he'd seen her, naked and under the influence of THC, at Nowicki's apartment on February 15, the day after her friends last saw her. Others testified that, years after Andrews vanished, Nowicki told people he had raped and strangled her and that her body would never be found.

Several of the crucial witnesses against Nowicki had been offered assistance of various kinds from the prosecution in exchange for their testimony, and many admitted to criminal histories and heavy drug use. Nowicki's attorneys called the evidence against him ""pathetic"" and maintained there was no proof Andrews was even deceased.

An extensive search of Nowicki's apartment and his Pulaski County, Indiana farm turned up no sign of Andrews's body. He was nevertheless convicted of rape and murder in July 2005, and sentenced to life in prison. Foul play is suspected in Andrews's case due to the circumstances involved. Her body has never been found.

Sarah Elizabeth Avon,"July 21, 1981","Joliet, Illinois",6,Caucasian / White,"4'0""",75 lbs,"Sarah was last seen with her sister at the end of Richards Street in Joliet, Illinois on July 21, 1981. The girls met friends at that location and Sarah walked away from the group after having an argument with another child. She was reported missing by her family at approximately 9:00 p.m. that evening, but no trace of her was found. Sarah has never been seen again.

A man told authorities in 1993 that he suspected his mentally disabled nephew had murdered Sarah in 1981. His nephew would have been a child at that time. The man also stated that he believed his nephew's father, who was deceased by 1993, had buried her body to protect his son. A vacant lot was excavated later in the year where authorities suspected Sarah may be buried, but nothing was located. Sarah's former babysitter had once lived in a residence where the lot was located.

In January 1985, three and a half years after Sarah vanished, police thought they saw her picture in the apartment of David R. Collins. Collins, who has a long criminal record and uses many aliases, was charged with kidnapping one teenager in California and sexually abusing several others in New Orleans, Louisiana. 25 pictures of young girls were found in his apartment; police published them in newspapers in hopes that the public could identify the people in them.

One of the subjects in the pictures was believed to be Sarah, but was eventually identified as another person. One other photograph was thought of be of Nelida Del Valle, a nine-year-old who disappeared from Massachusetts in 1976, but this possibility was also ruled out. Collins is not believed to have been involved in either girl's case.

Police dug underneath an old garage on Noel Road, south of Joliet, in 2004. They were hoping to find Sarah's remains. They did find some clothing, but they could not find any evidence relating to Sarah's case.

Some agencies may list February 21, 1981 as the date of Sarah's disappearance.

Veronica Jill Blumhorst,"September 20, 1990","Mendota, Illinois",21,Caucasian / White,"5'0"" - 5'1""
",100 lbs,"Veronica was last seen leaving her place of employment, the Super Value grocery store in Mendota, Illinois, at 1:07 a.m. September 20, 1990. She was supposed to the night shift for the first time in weeks; she'd taken time off work because she was recovering from an illness. She still felt sick and decided to leave work early and go home to sleep. She has never been heard from again.

Veronica's blue Chevrolet Corsica was found parked in her garage at her home four blocks away at 7:30 a.m. The garage door was closed and there was no sign of her at the scene. At the time of her disappearance, she resided with her parents and younger brother in the 1200 block of Monroe Street. She was supposed to give her brother a ride to school that morning, and when he realized he was gone he told their father, Paul, and drove to school in his own car.

Paul was initially not concerned because he assumed Veronica had decided to have breakfast with Jeff Veverka, her boyfriend of five months. At 10:30 a.m., however, Veverka called and Paul realized they weren't together. He checked with his oldest daughter, Carolyn, who lived in a nearby town. Carolyn said her sister wasn't with her either.

That afternoon, Veverka reported her missing. An extensive search of the area turned up no sign of Veronica. Dogs traced her scent from her family's garage to a nearby alley, then lost the trail.

Police interviewed Veverka on September 23. He'd been injured in a prior motorcycle accident and had problems with his memory as a result, and he wasn't sure what had happened on the night of Veronica's disappearance. He said he thought she might have called him at 9:30 p.m. on September 19 and talked about going to a doctor the next day because she was pregnant.

Veverka said it was possible he'd picked up Veronica that night, argued with her and pushed her, and that she got ""hurt real bad."" Authorities didn't take his statements seriously, however, because of his neurological problems.

Investigators do not believe Veronica left of her own accord, as she left behind all her clothing and her vehicle. She had no credit cards and her bank balance was only $4 when she disappeared. Authorities theorize that, after parking her car at her home, Veronica got into another vehicle with someone she knew.

A year after her disappearance, investigators searched Veverka's father's residence. Vevreka now maintains his innocence in her case and hasn't faced any charges relating to it, and no evidence was located during the search.

Veronica is described as a shy, retiring young woman. She was carrying less than $10 in cash on the night of her disappearance. Her work smock, purse and driver's license were found in her car, but her boyfriend's class ring and a video she'd rented were never recovered. Her case remains unsolved.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2372dfil.html

Trudy Leann Appleby,"August 21, 1996","Moline, Illinois",11,Caucasian / White,"4'8"" - 5'0""
",75 lbs - 85 lbs,"Trudy's father departed from their family's residence to report to work at approximately 9:00 a.m. on August 21, 1996 in Moline, Illinois. A neighbor saw Trudy enter a silver or gray four-door box-style vehicle, similar to a Chevrolet Celebrity, in the driveway of her home between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m.

The driver of the vehicle is described as being Caucasian and in his twenties at the time with curly brown or black hair worn long to his shoulders. The suspect was wearing a baseball cap. Neither Trudy nor her suspected abductor have been seen again. Her father reported her disappearance when he could not find her after he returned home from work.

Authorities believe that Trudy may have known the vehicle's driver. Her family's residence was located off of the main road and was not visible from the street. Her case was initially investigated as a possible runaway, but investigators now believe Trudy was abducted.

She took a swimsuit and a towel before departing from her home. She left approximately $200 behind, which her father said she saved for an upcoming vacation. Her case was initially treated as a runaway by police, but her parents never believed she left of her own accord and investigators now admit it is unlikely.

William ""Ed"" Smith was identified as the prime suspect in Trudy's disappearance in 2017. Smith, a friend of Trudy's father, died in 2014. A witness (reportedly his son-in-law, David Whipple), had seen Trudy in his car, and Smith threatened to kill him if the witness told the police about this.

Smith was seen alone later on the day of Trudy's disappearance, but Trudy was never seen again. He had his car scrapped within a week of Trudy's disappearance, and he acted ""despondent"" whenever her name was mentioned.

Trudy's father theorizes that Smith and Whipple took Trudy out on a boat on the Mississippi River and something unexpected happened, perhaps an accident, that lead to the child's death. Trudy was friends with one of Whipple's children and frequently accompanied their family on the boat. Whipple has refused to cooperate with investigators in Trudy's disappearance.

Police are appealing to anyone who might have seen any suspicious activity in the areas of Campbell's Island, Black Bird Island, Dynamite Island, or the boat launch at Empire Park in East Moline, Illinois. Trudy's case remains unsolved. Investigators stated that had little evidence and no solid suspects in her disappearance.

Robin Nadine Benedict,"March 5, 1983","Boston, Massachusetts",21,Caucasian / White,,,"Robin Benedict was last seen in Boston, Massachusetts on March 5, 1983. At the time of her disappearance, she was working as a high-class sex worker, charging about $100 an hour for her services. Authorities believe she was murdered by one of her clients, William Henry James Douglas, an anatomy professor at Tufts University Medical School.

According to prosecutors, Douglas met Benedict in April 1982 and quickly became obsessed with her. He paid for her vacations and bought her expensive gifts, including a car and a house. He wrote her many letters and called her several times a day. In December 1982, he broke into her apartment, stole her answering machines and used them to intercept her phone messages.

Benedict eventually began to perceive his attentions as harassment and tried to end the relationship. On March 2, she called his wife and told her she wanted Douglas to stop calling. He didn't stop, however; the day of Benedict's disappearance, he called her twelve times.

Benedict was last seen on March 5, en route to Douglas's home in the silver 1982 Toyota he'd bought her. She has never been heard from again. The next day, a teenager found a work shirt, a women's corduroy jacket smelling of perfume, and a hammer in a trash can along Interstate 95. All the items were bloodstained, and the hammer had a single dark hair stuck to it. The teenager turned the items in to the police, and Benedict's father and boyfriend/pimp identified the jacket as hers.

Police obtained a warrant and searched the Douglas home on March 20, fifteen days after Benedict's disappearance. They found her pocketbook, credit cards and personal phone book in Douglas's closet, and he said he didn't know how they got there. The police also found a man's bloodstained jacket with what appeared to be a piece of human tissue in the pocket. In July, Benedict's bloodstained vehicle was found in New York City near Penn Station.

Douglas was charged with first-degree murder in October 1983. He was also charged with embezzling $67,000 from Tufts University, money he allegedly spent on Benedict. In April 1984, on the morning his trial was scheduled to begin, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter and admitted he beat Benedict to death with a hammer in his home on the night of her disappearance. He stated he'd put her body in a dumpster in Rhode Island.

Although authorities searched the Central Landfill in Johnson, Rhode Island, Benedict's body has never been found. Douglas was later sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement, to be served concurrently with his manslaughter sentence. He was released from prison after serving eight and a half years.

Benedict graduated from the Greater Lawrence Regional Vocational School and studied for graphic design a year at the Rhode Island School of Design. She began dabbling in sex work while still in high school and turned to the career full-time after she dropped out of art school. She was arrested on sex work charges four times prior to her disappearance.

The store was located on the corner of Route 2 and Central Shaft Road, just a few hundred yards from Burdick's family's residence. She had been working at the store for three years.

Burdick's cousin called the store at approximately 8:00 p.m. on the night of April 17, 1982 to check on Burdick, who was scheduled to close The Barefoot Peddlar an hour from that time. Burdick told her cousin that a customer had arrived while they were speaking on the phone and she would have to hang up to attend to the person. She has never been heard from again.

Another customer entered the store approximately 40 minutes later and noticed that it was abandoned and the door was open. He was familiar with Burdick's family and called them to report her missing. Burdick's open book and half-empty soda were still on the store's counter, but her jacket from McCann Vocational Technical High School and her purse were missing.

$187 had been removed from the cash register, but additional cash was still available underneath the counter. Burdick would have been aware of the extra money, but an intruder would not have known about its placement.

Nothing in Burdick's life led authorities to believe she left of her own devices. Abduction was always assumed as the reason for her disappearance. One lead focused on an unidentified male who attempted to abduct a girl from the Williams College campus near Florida, Massachusetts that night Burdick disappeared. The intended victim managed to escape, but the attack took place approximately 40 minutes before Burdick was last seen.

A police officer believed he spotted the alleged suspect's vehicle traveling towards Florida on Route 2 a short time after the Williams College incident, but the car and driver could not be identified. The Barefoot Peddlar was located on Route 2, placing the suspect near Burdick's location at the time. It has since closed.

Investigators received an anonymous letter, postmarked Boston, from a man stating that his daughter had been abducted and murdered by a man in North Adams, Massachusetts in 1995. Authorities are familiar with the suspect named in the letter and pleaded for the letter's author to come forward with more information.

Judith Ann Chartier,"June 5, 1982","Chelmsford, Massachusetts",17,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",135 lbs,"Judith resided in Chelmsford, Massachusetts in 1982. On the night of June 5, she attended a party in Billerica, Massachusetts with her fiance of of four months. They had an argument during their stay and Judith drove her fiance to his home, then continued back to the party by herself. Witnesses told investigators that she left the party alone at approximately 2:00 a.m. Neither Judith nor the black 1972 or 1977 Dodge Dart she was driving have been located since that time.

Investigators with the Chelmsford Police Department received a tip from the U.S. Secret Service in Washington D.C., who were investigating a counterfeiting operation. One of the ring's suspects, James Mitchell DeBardeleben, was also believed to be connected to a number of murders.

Secret Service agents found a map of the Chelmsford region in the suspect's car, along with several photos of women involved in sadomasochistic acts. A receipt from a local motel in Chelmsford in the car; it was dated June 4, 1982, the day prior to Judith's disappearance. It is known that DeBardeleben liked brunettes, which fits Judith's profile, and he knew some of the people who attended the party in Billerica the night of Judith's disappearance.

Chelmsford police detectives attempted to work with DeBardeleben regarding Judith's case, but leads never panned out and he denied having ever met her. It is worth noting that DeBardeleben was ruled out as a suspect in the 1982 Michigan disappearance of Kellie Brownlee.

Judith was employed at a fast food restaurant in Chelmsford at the time of her 1982 disappearance. Her mother told authorities that Judith was being harrassed by a male co-worker at the time she vanished. Judith's mother also stated that her daughter was frightened of the employee. It is not known if the unidentified male is connected to Judith's disappearance.

Her brother Joe stated she was going through a rebellious phase in 1982 and may have gotten involved in criminal activity. The day before she disappeared, Judith asked her father to look in the trunk of her car, saying she was too frightened to do it herself. Joe believes she may have become a drug mule, perhaps unknowingly. After she went missing, an unidentified female called the Chartier home to say she knew what happened to Judith but couldn't say anything more because someone had threatened her life.

Judith's family believes she met with foul play at the hands of someone she knew. She has seven brothers, and was particularly close to Joe. Joe never thought she ran away, saying she was too close to mother to do that. He believes someone at the party she went to that night knows what happened to her. Joe describes his sister as a sweet, gentle person who loved animals.

Judith's parents are now both deceased. Her case remains open and unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/judith-ann-chartier,-71.3685608,42.5975764

Margaret Mary Kilcoyne,"January 26, 1980","Nantucket, MA",50,White,"5'0""",140 lbs,"Distinguishing Characteristics: Caucasian female. Red hair, blue eyes. Kilcoyne's nickname is Peg. She wears horn-rimmed eyeglasses.
Clothing/Jewelry Description: Possibly a yellow sweater.
Medical Conditions: Kilcoyne was experiencing severe mental stress at the time of her disappearance and may have been suffering from an episode of depression or mania.
Details of Disappearance: Kilcoyne was last seen at her secluded vacation home in Nantucket, Massachusetts on January 26, 1980. She went to bed at 10:00 or 10:30 p.m. Just before 7:00 a.m. the next day, when her brother came to wake her up for church as she had requested, she was gone. Her winter boots were on the floor and her only coat was hanging in the closet. Her bicycle and car were still in the garage. Kilcoyne has never been heard from again. Temperatures on the night she disappeared were well below zero degrees, and in subsequent days the weather was so cold that one of the search planes crashed because its carburetor froze.
Kilcoyne was a cardiologist doing research at Columbia University, looking for treatments for hypertension. Just before her disappearance, she told her loved ones she had made a dramatic breakthrough in her medical research and might win a Nobel Prize. Her colleagues stated they had in fact made a breakthrough, but that it wasn't as important a discovery as Kilcoyne thought it was. She did not leave a note explaining her actions, and she didn't tell anyone of any plans to leave. The day before she went missing, she bought $650 in groceries and $250 worth of liquor. All the grocery items were purchased in multiples of three. She told people at the grocery store that she was going to hold a party and press conference to announce her research findings. However, she didn't tell her family about any party, and she hadn't contacted the media or made any other arrangements to prepare for such an event.
Several days after her disappearance, searchers found Kilcoyne's passport, checkbook, summer sandals, and a wallet with $100 inside stacked neatly in a clearing near her home. The items were in a location that had been previously searched, and nothing had been found then. A clean brown long-sleeved blouse, believed to be Kilcoyne's, was found inside-out and rolled up under some brush about 150 yards away. Authorities said the blouse had been deliberately placed there and whoever did it would have to crawl through the brush on their hands and knees.
Kilcoyne's brother stated she was stressed over her work and he had been concerned for her mental well-being, which is why he came to her summer house the day before her disappearance. He decided to go see her after a phone conversation with her where Kilcoyne spoke very rapidly, was elated about her medical discovery, and also said she suspected she was being spied on at work. Her brother scheduled an appointment for her to see a psychiatrist for January 27, the day after her disappearance.
One prominent theory is that Kilcoyne killed herself, either intentionally or accidentally while in a delusional state, by walking into the ocean. Her family believes this is what happened, but some investigators in her case think she is alive and left of her own accord. She was declared legally dead in 1989, leaving behind a $200,000 estate. Foul play is not suspected in her case.

She was divorced with two young children when she vanished, and made a living as a waitress. Byars-Baisden's loved ones say she had no enemies and it would be uncharacteristic of her to abandon her children, who moved in with her sister and brother-in-law after her disappearance.

Some have suggested that Byars-Baisden's disappearance is related to the disappearance of Mary Cook, who vanished from Highland City in November 1970 and was never found. Both Cook and Byars-Baisden are the mothers of two children each, both were in their twenties, and they resided on the same street. However, investigators do not think the two women knew each other and have not been able to link their disappearances.

Foul play is suspected in Byars-Baisden's case; she is considered to be missing under suspicious circumstances.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/84dffl.html

Mary Margaret Cook,"November 14, 1970","Highland City, FL",25,"biracial, White/Caucasian and Native American","4'11""
",145-150 lbs,"Mary was last seen on November 14, 1970. Her husband says she left her home in Highland City, Florida to go on a shopping trip at the J. M. Fields store in Lakeland, Florida and buy Christmas presents for her two sons, then aged five and three. She never returned.

Her white 1959 Cadillac coupe was found abandoned in the store's parking lot the following day. Mary's wallet and purse were inside the car, but $200 which her husband supposedly gave her for the presents was missing. She left behind her wedding rings, which she normally wore all the time. No one saw her or her car at the store that day.

Investigators view Mary's husband, Leathern ""Earl"" Cook, as the prime suspect in her disappearance. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. They had been married for eight years at the time of Mary's disappearance in 1970.

Earl was interviewed extensively and in 2003, the police dug up the garage floor of the house they lived in in 1970, suspecting Mary's body might be buried there. Earl also provided them with a blood sample. They found no evidence and Earl was never charged.

He always maintained his innocence in her case and told their children that Mary left of her own accord. Earl remarried two years after Mary's disappearance, got divorced in 2000, married a third time and died in Greenacres, Florida in 2007, at the age of 66.

Mary's oldest son stated he saw his parents arguing on the day of his mother's disappearance and that Earl told him not to look outside. He believes Mary's body was concealed in a red blanket from the house and was buried within some hours' distance of Highland City.

Mary's mother took care of her sons for some time after her disappearance, but when she found out the police suspected Earl was involved, she confronted him and directly asked if he'd killed Mary. He never answered; instead, he simply took the boys and left.

Some have suggested that Mary's disappearance is related to the disappearance of Peggy Byars-Baisden, who vanished from Highland City in April 1965. Both Mary and Byars-Baisden are the mothers of two children each, both were in their twenties, and they resided on the same street. However, investigators do not think the two women knew each other and have not been able to link their disappearances.

Mary was a stay-at-home mother at the time of her disappearance. Earl often went to West Palm Beach, Florida, hours away from Highland City, for painting jobs during the week and returned to Highland City to spend weekends at home. Foul play is suspected in Mary's case, but little evidence is available in her disappearance.","http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1383dffl.html

Pamela J. Butler,"February 12, 2009",Washington D.C.,47,African American / Black,"5'3""",120 lbs,"Butler was last seen talking to her boyfriend, Jose Angel Rodriguez-Cruz, at her home in the 5800 block of 4th Street northwest in Washington D.C. at 9:48 p.m. on February 12, 2009. The following day she sent two emails, one to her employer and one to a relative. She has never been heard from again.

Butler was very concerned about personal safety and her residence has a sophisticated security system with an alarm, motion-activated floodlights and surveillance cameras positioned at all the exits. She kept the home in a very neat, clean condition.

When her brother checked the house, he found the sheets from her bed were missing, the bed's comforter was on a settee in the bedroom, some real estate files were on the floor in her home office, and blinds on one of the windows in the second floor dining room were raised. It would be uncharacteristic of Butler to leave the blinds up, as she didn't want neighbors to see into her home.

That particular window was the only one in the house that was unlocked. The door alarm was turned off, and her family says she always set it before she left home.

Authorities searched her home after her disappearance and found no evidence of foul play. She left behind her vehicles, a gray Mercedes-Benz and a gold Jaguar, but her purse, credit card, driver's license and keys disappeared with her.

Jose stated Butler broke up with him on the evening of February 13. They met through an internet dating website and had been together for five months. He said the split was amicable, but sudden, and he didn't understand why Butler wanted to the end the relationship.

The surveillance videos show him leaving the house at 11:30 p.m. on February 13. He was filmed coming in and out of Butler's house three times in the days following her disappearance. He says he was removing his belongings from the home and dropping off other items; this would be consistent with the video, which showed him carrying bags away.

The video didn't show Butler leaving the house; the last time she was filmed was on the evening of February 12, when she went out to get her mail, then came back inside.

Jose initially cooperated with the investigation and allowed the police to question him and search his home. Authorities focused on him as a possible suspect. They impounded his car and some other belongings and questioned him aggressively. He agreed to take a polygraph, but then refused and walked out just before the exam was to begin. Following that incident, he ceased cooperating, saying he felt he was being railroaded by overzealous police officers.

Jose had some prior minor run-ins with the law, but no serious criminal record and has never served time in jail. Butler's relatives, including a nephew who lived with her off and on during the relationship, said she and Jose seemed happy and got along well, with only minor arguments. They said they had no idea she was planning to break up with him.

In April 2017, Jose was charged with Butler's murder. Investigators stated they had uncovered evidence of domestic violence in his background. A photo of Jose is posted with this case summary. He was given a general discharge from the Army prior to his disappearance because of instability, and he had twice previously threatened to harm his female boss.

Jose's first wife, Marta ""Haydee"" Rodriguez, disappeared from Arlington, Virginia on May 26, 1989. She had accused him of domestic violence and they were estranged when she went missing.

The missing persons report was canceled in 2000 after police supposedly made contact with Haydee in Florida, but authorities subsequently learned the Florida woman they'd spoken to was in fact Jose's second wife's sister and she'd impersonated Haydee, using Haydee's date of birth and other identifying information which Jose supplied to her.

In October 2017, Jose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Pamela's case and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. He admitted that he beat and strangled her to death after an argument about his unemployment. He lead authorities to a place where he said he dumped her body, but the area has since been paved and investigators don't know if Butler's body is recoverable.

In June 2018, Haydee's body was identified. Her body was found along Interstate 95 in February 1991, about a mile from where Jose would later dispose of Butler's body. In October 2019, over a year after Haydee's body was identified, Jose was charged with first-degree murder and the unlawful concealment of her body.

Butler had a bachelor's degree in information technology and a master's degree in public administration from American University. Her single, brief marriage ended amicably in the 1990s. At the time of her disappearance, she was employed as a computer systems analyst with the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). She earned a six-figure salary with the EPA, and supplemented her income with real estate investments.

Butler was stressed over financial problems at the time of her disappearance; her investments had declined in value due to the bad economy. She kept in close contact with her family and had a regular routine and an orderly life, and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.

Foul play is suspected in Butler's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.findthemissing.org/en/cases/7964

Robert Andre Ruff and Frank Johnson forced her into a car at gunpoint and drove away with her. Both men were found guilty of the crime in 1982. The following year, they were charged with Gaisior's murder and Johnson pleaded guilty.

Johnson stated that after Gaisior's kidnapping, he and Ruff took her to the bank and forced her to withdraw money from her account. After that, they drove her to the Diplomat Hotel on New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. and sexually assaulted her there. Ruff shot Gaisior with Johnson's gun and threw her body in the Potomac River at Anacostia Park. Ruff was convicted largely on the basis of Johnson's testimony.

She worked as a nursing assistant. Her former brother-in-law, Vernon Eugene Calloway, paid her a visit and told her that her ex-husband, his brother Larry Ray Calloway, had filed for a license to marry his girlfriend. Patricia and Larry had been divorced for a year, but still lived together.

Patricia went to her boss, very upset, and said she had to leave work early due to a family emergency. She left the nursing home at 10:30 a.m., three hours before the scheduled end of her shift, and has never been heard from again. At 5:00 p.m. the same day, Patricia's car was found in the side lot of the Hartford Community Center. She was reported missing on March 13.

Authorities initially believed Patricia had left of her own accord, but later said she was missing under suspicious circumstances and probably dead. Investigators think she was blackmailing Larry at the time of her disappearance by threatening to go to the police and implicate him in a 1991 arson case.

Patricia was seen with Vernon in his 1978 Chevrolet Blazer on the day she disappeared. He had allegedly threatened to cut her throat. Larry and Vernon were later charged with the arson of Larry's home. Larry pleaded guilty in 1995 and said he'd paid Vernon $1,000 to burn down the residence, but Vernon was acquitted at trial.

Patricia left behind three adult children and several grandchildren and step-grandchildren. She didn't take any clothes or very much money when she disappeared, and she never picked up her last paycheck or accessed her bank account. Her family held a memorial service for her in March 2000, seven years after she vanished, and she was declared legally dead in December 2001.

In October 2012, nearly a decade after Patricia's disappearance, Vernon and his wife, Debra Angeline Calloway, were charged with murder in her case. Photos of the suspects are posted with this case summary. Both of them maintained that they were not involved in Patricia's disappearance and they believed she had simply walked out of her life after she found out her ex-husband was planning to marry another woman.

Vernon died of natural causes in July 2013, before he could be tried. His sister later testified that he confessed to the murder shortly before his death. Debra was tried for murder, retaliation, evidence tampering and kidnapping in 2014, but the kidnapping charge was dismissed during the trial.

Larry testified that Patricia had been present when he and Vernon plotted to burn down Larry's house for the insurance money, and she was also there when Larry paid Vernon for his role in the crime.

James, another of Larry's brothers, testified also and said he saw Debra and Vernon cleaning out Vernon's truck. In the back was something covered in the trash bags; James pulled the bags away and saw Patricia's body. Her throat, he said, had been cut. He didn't come forward with his statement until 2008.

A jury found Debra guilty of facilitation to commit murder, facilitation to retaliate against a witness in a legal proceeding, and evidence tampering; she was sentenced to ten years in prison.

She she she was going to visit her estranged husband, Bill Crider Jr., at the Holiday Inn on Athens-Boonesboro Road, where he lived. She never returned.

Joyce left behind all her belongings, including her knee brace and her dogs. Her car, a dark green 1993 Nissan Infiniti G20 with the Kentucky license plate number 035-DKD, disappeared with her.

It was found, covered with snow, in a parking lot on Winchester Road in December 2002, six weeks after she vanished. There were indications that someone other than Joyce drove the vehicle to that location.

Joyce was having personal problems at the time she disappeared. She and her husband were in the process of a divorce, which was finalized in 2003. Joyce's home and all its contents had been destroyed in a gas explosion the year she disappeared, her husband's truck had caught fire and was ruined, one her dogs had died suddenly, and the Criders were involved in several lawsuits.

Bill said Joyce became depressed after their house was destroyed and threatened to commit suicide. She sought medical assistance and was prescribed medication for her depression. Her attorney and her loved ones stated she was in good spirits at the time of her disappearance and looking forward to getting on with her life.

Bill was Joyce's second husband; her first marriage, in 1998, lasted only four months. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

The Criders' divorce was acrimonious and there was a court order prohibiting them from contacting each other. Joyce disappeared the day before she was scheduled to give a deposition in the divorce case; she was allegedly going to implicate her husband in insurance fraud.

Bill admitted he initially lied about when he last saw Joyce. He's considered a person of interest in Joyce's disappearance. Police searched his property several times looking for her remains, but they found nothing.

Bill maintained his innocence in her case and stated he had proof that Joyce was still alive. He was killed in a car accident in February 2013, over a decade after her disappearance.

Joyce was taking a course in medical transcription at the time of her disappearance. She has previously done clerical work for various retail stores. Her hobbies include watching movies and collecting dolls and clowns. Joyce's bank accounts and cellular phone have been inactive since her disappearance.

Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected. She was declared legally dead in November 2009.

In February 2007, one of her eight children went to her apartment to check on her and found a tall man she knew only as John. John gave Brussow's daughter a bag of Brussow's belongings and said he had last seen her getting into a semi truck. Brussow has never been heard from again. Her family reported her missing on February 24.

The police were never able to identify or interview the man at Brussow's apartment. She hasn't been in touch with her family since mid-October 2006, and since her disappearance there hasn't been any activity on her bank account. Her family stated she kept in regular touch with them and they don't believe she would have gone so long without contacting her children and grandchildren.

Brussow's family believes she's dead, and police are not ruling out foul play in her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/elizabeth-alice-brussow

Orla Alyne J. Barrick,"April 12, 1996","Mammoth Cave, Kentucky",61,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",120 lbs,"Barrick was last seen walking her Pomeranian dog on Laurel Ridge Road in rural Mammoth Cave, Kentucky on April 12, 1996. She had a short conversation with someone at approximately 2:00 p.m. She has never been heard from again.

Barrick's neighborhood mostly consisted of vacation homes; she only had two permanent neighbors. One of her neighbors reported her missing three days later, after realizing she hadn't been out to walk her dog in several days.

When the police went to Barrick's home, the lights were off and the doors were all locked, but there were indications of a struggle. A sofa in the living room was pushed out of place and the living room carpet was bloodstained. In the bedroom, the bed's fitted sheet was missing and the other bedclothes were piled on top of the mattress, bloodstained. A glass that normally sat on the nightstand was on the floor.

There was no sign of Barrick. Besides her fitted bedsheet, the only other item missing from inside her home was her clutch purse. Her dentures were soaking in their container and there was a burned-out cigarette on the bathroom shelf. The lights were turned off, and Barrick's dog was locked in its crate. She normally took the trash out every evening; the bag of trash was found on top of her kitchen counter.

The $400 in cash Barrick kept in her freezer was still there, but the key she normally kept hidden in a fake rock outside her house was missing. Her truck was parked nearby with the house keys inside it, and the truck keys were inside the house. It appeared as if Barrick had been getting ready for bed when her nighttime routine had been suddenly interrupted.

Barrick is a widow and lived alone at the time of her disappearance. She enjoyed fishing and growing roses, and she is an accomplished seamstress who made her four children's clothes when they were young. She was reportedly dating a younger man, but her family didn't know the man's name.

Foul play is suspected in her case, which is being treated as a homicide. Authorities believe her body may be buried in a shallow grave in the woods near her home.","http://charleyproject.org/case/orla-alyne-j-barrick

Marsha Ellen Brantley,"May 15, 2009","Cleveland, Tennessee",51,Caucasian / White,"5'8""",125 lbs,"Marsha was last seen in Cleveland, Tennessee sometime in late May or early June 2009. She lived with her husband of nine years and three dogs in the Benwood subdivision of Cleveland at the time of her disappearance. Her parents are deceased and she has no children.

A friend reported Marsha missing in November 2009, after months without contact. When questioned by police, her husband, Donnie Ray Brantley, stated she had simply left him and they planned to get a divorce. Investigators searched her home for evidence, but didn't find anything.

Prior to her disappearance, Marsha enjoyed spending time in an RV she owned in Townsend, Tennessee. Authorities were unable to find the RV until November 2012, when it turned up on property owned by Donnie's family. Donnie was arrested at that time and charged with hindering a creditor; authorities believe he was hiding the vehicle to keep it from being repossessed.

In August 2013, Donnie was additionally charged with Marsha's murder. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. The charges were dropped for lack of evidence in 2014, but Donnie was charged with murder again in December 2016. The prosecution dropped the case again in February 2018, but the charges were dismissed without prejudice, meaning Donnie could be charged a third time if more evidence surfaces.

Marsha previously worked for Lee University. She enjoys hiking and other outdoor pursuits, and she is an award-winning writer. She is childless, her parents died in 2000, and she wasn't close to any of her blood relatives; it wasn't for several months that her aunt in North Carolina found out she had disappeared.

Amber Elizabeth Cates,"April 11, 2004","Columbia, 	Tennessee",16,White/Caucasian,"5'5""",100-125 lbs,"Amber was last seen in Maury County, Tennessee on April 11, 2004. She left her mother's home in the 2300 block of Tracy Lane with James Gordon, one of her friends, in a gold Mazda with the license plates number PFB-200. She was supposed to return in two days, but never did and has never been heard from again.

When questioned about Amber's disappearance, Gordon said he'd left her with another friend, Ronald ""California"" Inzurriaga. They were supposed to go to get a meal at the Waffle House restaurant on James Campbell Boulevard.

Authorities have since located Inzurriaga in a federal prison in Alabama. He said he dropped Amber off at a garage in Columbia, Tennessee after she purchased hair dye, and he doesn't know what happened to her after that.

Amber was born in Spring Hill, Tennessee and lived in several states, then returned to Tennessee to live in a foster home. Her older half-sister, Brenda James, stated Amber had gotten involved with the wrong crowd and was drinking and occasionally using drugs. James became her legal guardian just a few days before she went missing.

Amber was originally considered to be a runaway, but the passage of time since her disappearance has led investigators to consider whether other factors caused her to disappear. She has a driver's license, but there have been no infractions listed on her driving record. Her Social Security number has gone unused since 2004, and she hasn't used her cellular phone either.

James believes Amber is deceased. If she's alive, she may be in Georgia or Texas, or she may still be in the Maury County area. Her case remains unsolved.

She was supposed to go to work the next day at the Shoney's restaurant in Lenoir City, Tennessee, but never showed up.

That day, someone identifying herself as Karen called a towing service, Colyer Wrecker Service, and gave them directions so they could tow her car. Investigators believe the caller may not have really been Karen, however; the towing service employee who took the call listened to a recording of Karen's voice and said it wasn't the same person who called him. She has never been heard from again.

Karen's lawyer reported her missing on January 23 after she missed an appointment. When the lawyer and the police went to her apartment in Harriman, Tennessee, they found it undisturbed with no indications of forced entry or a struggle. Her purse, wallet and car keys were at the apartment. Her car was found near the Center Ferry Bridge at the Clinch River, less than a mile from Karen's former in-laws' home.

Prior to her disappearance, Karen was involved in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband, Reece Beard. They had separated in California in 1985. Reece was given custody of their two daughters by default in 1987 after Karen failed to appear for a custody hearing. She later went to Tennessee to try and get the children back.

The two girls reportedly said they wanted to live with their mother. There were charges of alcoholism, adultery, drug abuse and drug dealing on both sides, and Karen was reportedly ""mortally afraid"" of Reece. She asked her sister to become her children's legal guardian if anything should happen to her.

Karen did have a history of cocaine and methamphetamine use and was hospitalized for her drug problem in California in 1985, but her sister stated she had gotten clean in order to be a better parent to her children. Her sister stated Reece was the father of Karen's unborn child, but Reece denied it. Karen's former mother-in-law described her as unstable and stated she had dropped out of sight before, once for nearly a year.

Authorities believe Karen was taken to a house in Kingston and killed, and her body disposed of. They viewed several of Reece's friends as suspects in Karen's disappearance. Years later, as one of them was dying of cancer, he asked to speak with investigators. By the time the police arrived at the hospital to interview him, however, he had died.

No one has ever been charged in Karen's disappearance, but foul play is strongly suspected. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/26173

The day before she disappeared, Paula had called the police to have Donald removed from the house. She asked her father to stay overnight with her because she was afraid Donald would return and harm her.

Donald called Paula's father on September 17 and asked him to pick up their children, saying Paula needed a vacation. Paula's father reported her as a missing person when she failed to make contact with loved ones by September 21, four days after she was last seen.

Paula has never been heard from again. Her driver's license was discovered in the 9500 block of Harrison Bay Road in Harrison sometime during October 1996, approximately one month after she disappeared.

Donald and an accomplice, James Travis White, took an AmSouth Bank branch manager and her family hostage in November 1996. The men forced the manager to rob her own bank after driving around with her family overnight. Both suspects were arrested one month after in the incident in December 1996.

Carie's husband, Edward Zapletal, had had a stroke a few months prior to her disappearance, and he stated she became depressed, started abusing prescription drugs and even attempted suicide afterwards.

Carie's children don't believe she would have abandoned her family, and they think foul play was involved in her case. Edward died in 2018. Carie's disappearance remains unsolved.

Nichole R. Burgess,"May 23, 2014","Nashville, Tennessee",37,Caucasian / White,"5'1""",125 lbs,"Burgess was last seen in Nashville, Tennessee on May 23, 2014. She sent a text message to a friend that day, and this is the last time anyone heard from her. She had planned to go to Sparta, Tennessee the next day but never showed up, and when her friends checked her house in the 900 block of Oak Vale Drive they noticed her car was still parked in the driveway with her purse inside it.

The house, which was normally kept tidy, was in disarray. Burgess's two dogs were running loose without any food or water laid out for them, and they had defecated several times on the floor.

Neighbors reported seeing a car they didn't recognize in Burgess's driveway the weekend of her disappearance. One of them, a close friend of Burgess, reported seeing two individuals carrying something heavy out the back door of the house in the early morning hours of May 24. The witness recognized one of the people as Caleb J. Cannon, the father of Burgess's son, who was ten years old at the time of his mother's disappearance.

In October 2015, Cannon was charged with Burgess's murder. He saw their son every other weekend, and she had mentioned him in her final text message and said they were arguing. A photo of Cannon is posted with this case summary. After Burgess's disappearance, their son told a friend he might not see his mother anymore because she was ""probably dead"" and he thought his father had killed her.

Cadaver-sniffing dogs detected the scent of human remains at both Burgess's home and in the trunk of Cannon's car. Empty bottles of cleaning fluid, brass knuckles and bloodstained bedding were found in Burgess's home after her disappearance. Authorities believe Cannon murdered her inside her home, put her body in the trunk and disposed of it in an unspecified location.

Cannon was tried for Burgess's murder in May 2017; their son testified against him. He maintained his innocence, but the jury convicted him after less than two hours' deliberation. He was given an automatic life sentence.

Foul play is suspected in Burgess's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/24759

Marlena Danyele Childress,"April 16, 1987","Union City, Tennessee",4,Caucasian / White,"4'0""",38 lbs,"Marlena was last seen playing in the front yard of her family's residence in Union City, Tennessee at approximately 3:00 p.m. on April 16, 1987. Her mother, Pamela Lynn Bailey, stated she heard car brakes and when she went to check on Marlena, the child was gone.

Bailey said she didn't get a good look at the driver, but Marlena's seven-year-old stepbrother and the owner of a store two blocks away both told police they'd seen Marlena talking to him shortly before she vanished. Their descriptions of the car matched what Bailey said she'd seen, but no one recognized the driver. The vehicle is described as an older model two-door red car. It reportedly had McCracken County, Kentucky license plates. Marlena has never been heard from again.

Two months after Marlena's disappearance, her mother told investigators that she had hit her while trying to discipline her and had unintentionally killed her. She said she disposed of the body in the north fork of the Obion River.

Bailey said a local man had helped her dispose of the body, and he was questioned by police, but he denied any involvement, saying he knew Bailey but he hadn't even seen her in two years. He also had an alibi for the day Marlena disappeared. The man was never charged in connection with her disappearance.

Marlena's body was never located and Bailey recanted her confession shortly afterwards, stating she had made up the story because she was emotionally distressed, taking medication for depression, and being pressured by the police.

Bailey made several conflicting statements about her daughter's disappearance: at one point she said she had sold Marlena to pay off a drug debt, and another time she said Marlena had been abducted by a family friend who had sexually abused Bailey when she was a child.

Bailey moved to Kentucky after Marlena disappeared. She had initially been charged with second-degree murder in connection with her daughter's alleged death

The charge was later reduced to voluntary manslaughter, then dropped altogether for lack of evidence. Prior to Marlena's disappearance, no one had filed any complaints of child abuse or neglect in the family.

There were reports that Marlena had been seen in Anniston, Alabama in the months following her disappearance. She was supposedly staying with a family there in the late summer of 1987. Their surname was also Childress, but they aren't related to Marlena.

The family had a history of harboring other people's children. They traveled to Florida, where the father was arrested on sex charges relating to his wife and two of his ten children. Neighbors from Anniston identified photos of Marlena as the child they had seen at the residence, but these sightings were never confirmed.

Bailey was arrested in Kentucky in late April 2002 after she stabbed her twelve-year-old son in a rural cemetery in Graves County. The child survived the attack, stayed overnight in the hospital, and was released to his father. Bailey pleaded no contest to attempted murder, served time in prison and has since been released.

Marlena's disappearance continues to be classified as a non-family abduction. Her case was re-opened by the police after Bailey's 2002 arrest, but it remains unsolved.","http://trailwentcold.com/2018/09/19/the-trail-went-cold-episode-90-marlena-childress/

Karin Julianna Wetzl,"November 1, 2008","Charlotte Amalie, VI",36,White,"5'5""",120 lbs,"Karin Wetzl was last seen in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands sometime in October 2008. She disappeared along with her boyfriend, Canute Joseph. Joseph was born on St. Thomas; Wetzl is from the mainland United States and had been staying in the Virgin Islands for only about a year.

They led a transient lifestyle and lived in Joseph's car. In the fall of 2008, Wetzl got a job at the Calypso Cafe in the A.H. Riise Mall in Charlotte Amalie and Joseph got a job at Quality Foods. The couple vanished only a few days after starting their new jobs. Neither of them have been heard from again.

It's not uncharacteristic of Wetzl to be out of touch with her family, so they were initially unconcerned when they didn't hear from her. They began to worry after Thanksgiving and Christmas passed without contact, and her father in Texas reported her missing in January 2009.

The police, searching for Wetzl, got in touch with Joseph's brother in February. His brother reported him missing at that time.

Foul play is possible in Wetzl and Joseph's cases. In 2009, authorities found a woman's body that they think might be Wetzl's. The victim, who had been shot in the head, had a necklace similar to one Wetzl wore and had also broken her arm before, like Wetzl had. The body has not been identified, however.

Shizue Fujioka Cronin,"March 4, 1995","Tamuning, Guam",60,Asian (Japanese descent),"5'1""",110 lbs,"Cronin was last seen in Tamuning, Guam on March 4, 1995. She was supposed to meet some friends at the Tropicana Hotel on March 6, but never arrived there. She has never been heard from again.

At the time of her disappearance, she was married to a local attorney and they owned Hillside Apartments and three-quarters of the Polynesian Motel. She was also president of Ypao Plaza Co.

Cronin's son in California, Francis L'Esperance, reported her as a missing person in July 1995 and said he had not heard from her since March. Authorities discovered that Cronin's husband had reported her missing in May 1995, but later he said he was traveling in Europe, so police closed the report.

Cronin's children in the mainland United States, however, said she was not in fact in Europe, so the investigation was reopened. She had a habit of taking spontaneous trips to Europe or Japan, but she always kept in touch with her family at least once a week.

L'Eseperance spent two weeks looking for his mother in Guam before giving up and returning home. He and his sister in New York later offered a reward for her safe return.

Cronin's employees at the Polynesian Motel say they last saw her in late February 1995, and noted it was uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. (The motel was later renamed the Micronesian Motel and has since been destroyed in a typhoon.)

Cronin has not been in contact with anyone or withdrawn any money from her financial accounts since 1995. Police checked every port of entry, both by sea and by air, and found no evidence that she had left the island.

Foul play is suspected in Cronin's case. She may be buried under a swimming pool; she was last seen in that area and disappeared around the time the pool was poured. She had lived in Guam for over twenty years before her disappearance. Her disappearance remains unsolved.

Some agencies give the place of Cronin's disappearance as Mountain View, California. Mountain View authorities are assisting the investigation, as she owned a residence there.

Samantha Burns,"November 11, 2002","Huntington, West Virginia",19,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",110 lbs,"Burns used her cellular phone to call her mother from Huntington, West Virginia at 9:45 p.m. on November 11, 2002. She said she had been visiting friends at Marshall University Court Yard Apartments and was on her way home. Burns lived in East Hamlin, West Virginia at the time. She never arrived there and has never been heard from again.

The call to her mother was the last one Burns made on her phone. After her disappearance the phone was discovered to be turned off, which is uncharacteristic of her.

Burns's burgundy 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, which has a tiger sticker in the back window on the driver's side and the license plates number 5X9326, was found abandoned in Wayne County, West Virginia at 3:30 a.m. on November 12. The vehicle was discovered in a secluded area at German Ridge and Haneys Branch Roads, near the Cabell-Wayne county line. It had been set on fire and was still burning when police found it. There was no sign of Burns near the vehicle.

Within a few days of Burns's disappearance, police identified two suspects in her presumed abduction, Chadwick E. Fulks and Branden L. Basham (sometimes called ""L. Branden Basham""). The two men escaped from Hopkins County Jail on November 4, a week before Burns's disappearance, and embarked on a multi-state crime spree, including numerous robberies, car thefts, and at least one burglary. They were recaptured after Burns vanished.

Basham confessed to abducting and murdering Alice Donovan, who disappeared on November 14, 2002 in Conway, South Carolina. Her dark blue 1994 BMW 318i was found in Goshen, Indiana. Basham says he only helped kidnap her and it it was Fulks who raped, stabbed and strangled her.

Both men were charged with carjacking resulting in death and kidnapping resulting in death in connection with Donovan's case; they were convicted in separate trials and sentenced to death. In January 2009, bone chips later identified as Donovan's were found in Horry County, South Carolina.

In June 2003, Basham and Fulks were also charged with carjacking resulting in death in Burns's case. Her body has not been found, but authorities believed they can prove the case with circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors stated that the men abducted Burns and, before killing her, held her at gunpoint while they drove her car around and tried, with some success, to withdraw money at various ATMs

Basham pleaded guilty to murdering Burns in July 2005 and was sentenced to life in prison. He confessed in court to his involvement in the crime, and apologized to Burns's family. The case's outcome for Fulks has not been determined.

Both men are on death row in South Carolina. Burns and Donovan's families filed wrongful death lawsuits against them and against the Hopkins County Jail. The suit against the jail was settled for an undisclosed amount in August 2008.

At the time of her disappearance, Burns lived at home with her parents and younger brother. She was enrolled in Marshall's Community and Technical College, in the physical therapy assistant program. She also worked part time at a J.C. Penney department store in the Huntington Mall.

Burns remains missing. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/411

Holsomback stated Crouse disappeared on November 4, after an argument between them. She reached out to a neighbor for help after the disagreement, but vanished shortly afterwards. She has never been heard from again. Her family believes Holsomback was involved, but was told there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against anyone in Crouse's disappearance.

Shaquita Yolanda Bell,"June 27, 1996","Alexandria, Virginia",23,African American / Black,"5'6"" - 5'7""
",150 lbs - 170 lbs,"Bell was last seen leaving her family's residence in the 300 block of Raymond Street in Alexandria, Virginia on June 27, 1996. She was accompanied by her ex-boyfriend, Michael Eric Dickerson, at the time; they were riding in his gray 1987 Cadillac Fleetwood with tinted windows. A photograph of Dickerson is posted with this case summary.

He was supposed to be driving Bell while she took two of her three children to a doctor's appointment. She called home at 2:00 p.m. to say she would be returning there shortly, but she never arrived and has never been heard from again. When questioned, Dickerson claimed he and Bell had gone to southeast Washington D.C. together and had an argument and she had left him there.

Bell's family believe Dickerson had been abusing her for some time prior to June 1996. Her mother stated Dickerson would not allow Bell to attend church, and neighbors reported hearing frequent loud arguments between the couple. A month before her disappearance, Bell told the police that Dickerson, who lived with her in Laurel, Virginia, had beaten her.

Dickerson was charged with malicious wounding and Bell moved in with her grandmother in Alexandria. She wrote down an account of the attack. Three weeks later, Bell reported that Dickerson had threatened her and held a loaded 9-millimeter gun to her head, and he was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm as a result.

After Bell's disappearance, her purse was found in the vehicle of Jonathan ""Jody"" Shields, a friend of Dickerson. Shields told investigators that Dickerson told him he had killed Bell in Washington D.C. Dickerson allegedly asked Shields for help in getting rid of the body. They traveled to Dickerson's house and Shields saw Bell's body lying in the yard. He says he acted as a lookout while Dickerson wrapped the corpse in a blanket and put it in his own car.

Shields and Dickerson then went to a wooded area alongside Old Fort Road in Fort Washington, Maryland, and Dickerson buried the body. Shields agreed to visit Dickerson in jail and wear an audio recording device in hopes of recording Dickerson's confession to Bell's murder. On June 6, 1999, day before the visit was scheduled, he was murdered. His murder remains unsolved.

In March 1997, authorities dug up the yard of Dickerson's parents' home in the 3200 block of G Street southeast in Washington D.C. They found no evidence relating to Bell's case. Dickerson was convicted of beating Bell after her disappearance. Bell's handwritten account of the assault was used as evidence against him.

Bell was employed as a clerk at the Giant Food bakery at the time of her disappearance. She does not have a criminal record or any history of leaving without warning. Her loved ones don't believe she would have abandoned her children, the youngest of whom was only an infant in 1996.

Two of her previous boyfriends had been shot to death, and one of the homicides is considered to be drug-related. At the time of her disappearance, Bell was afraid for her life and kept a diary to be used as evidence in case she was murdered.

In January 2008, while still incarcerated for assaulting Bell, Dickerson was charged with her murder and with the murder of another man, Sean A. Thomas, who was shot to death on the street in February 1996. Bell was interviewed by police about Thomas's murder in June 1996, and stated Dickerson had told her he committed the crime.

When police told Dickerson he was a suspect in Thomas's murder, he told them he knew Bell must have reported him. Investigators believe he killed Bell at least in part because she of her knowledge of Thomas's murder.

In October 2008, Dickerson pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Bell's case and also admitted to Thomas's homicide. As part of the plea agreement, he wasn't prosecuted in Thomas's case. He led authorities to a wooded area in Prince George's County, Maryland where he says he buried Bell's body, but digging there has thus far not produced any evidence.

Dickerson will serve fifteen years in prison without parole eligibility. Foul play is suspected in Bell's case due to the circumstances involved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/shaquita-yolanda-bell

On June 24, twelve days after Bradshaw was last seen, a man was driving Bradshaw's aqua 1964 Oldsmobile when police stopped him and issued a traffic citation. He was the brother of a friend of Bradshaw's.

It's unclear why this man was using her vehicle or whether he had anything to do with her disappearance, but after police realized Bradshaw was missing, they were unable to find either the man or Bradshaw's car.

Bradshaw had been living in Cumberland for about six months prior to her disappearance; prior to that, she lived with her brother in Powhatan, Virginia. He reported her missing on July 7. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/20764

Melissa Lee Brannen,"December 3, 1989","Lorton, Virginia",5,Caucasian / White,"3'0""",38 lbs,"Melissa was last seen at a holiday party in the Woodside Apartment Clubhouse, at approximately 10:00 p.m. on December 3, 1989 in Lorton, Virginia. Her family resided in the apartment complex. Melissa and her mother were about to leave the party but Melissa went to get some more potato chips before they left, and was never seen again. There were approximately eighty guests present at the party at the time.

Caleb Daniel Hughes emerged as a suspect in Melissa's case almost immediately. Photos of him are posted with this case summary. Hughes was employed as a groundskeeper at Woodside Apartments at the time of Melissa's disappearance; he had worked there for only about two weeks.

He was a guest at Melissa's family's party the evening of her disappearance, had been sitting near her when she was last seen, and left at approximately the same time the child was discovered missing. He had a criminal record prior to Melissa's disappearance, but not for violent or sexual offenses.

Investigators looked for Hughes right after Melissa's disappearance was discovered, but did not find him until 1:00 a.m. the next day. He had already put his party clothes in the washing machine. The FBI took blood, hair and fiber evidence from Hughes's maroon Honda and tested it in a forensic laboratory.

The laboratory found that Melissa could be a source for the hair and the bloodstains, which were found on some tissues in the car, but so could 40% of the general population. Further testing ruled out Melissa as a source for the stains. However, rabbit hairs found in the car matched Melissa's rabbit-fur jacket and there were many blue fibers that matched her sweater and some red fibers consistent with her skirt.

Hughes was convicted of abducting Melissa with the intent to defile in 1991, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. He has always maintained his innocence in Melissa's case. He was an exemplary prisoner for most of his term, and accumulated enough good behavior credits to shorten his sentence. As a result, he was released from prison in August 2019, after serving just 29 years of his sentence.

Two other men were convicted of attempting to extort ransom money from Melissa's mother shortly after her daughter's disappearance. The individuals were not connected to her actual abduction. Melissa has never been located. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/1797

Amy Lynn Bradley,"March 24, 1998","Curacao, Netherlands Antilles",23,White,"5'6""",120 lbs,"Bradley was vacationing with her parents and her brother aboard Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's ship, Rhapsody of the Seas, during March 1998. She and her brother returned to their cabin at approximately 3:30 a.m. on March 24, 1998 after dancing at the ship's disco. They sat on their suite's balcony until approximately 5:30 a.m.

Bradley's brother stayed in the cabin, while she mentioned possibly disembarking at Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles to purchase cigarettes. At 6:00 a.m., two other passengers on the ship saw her riding the elevator to the top deck. Bradley was last seen carrying her room key, cigarettes, and a lighter when she was last seen. She had a hundred dollars in her pocket as well.

Rhapsody of the Seas was preparing to dock in Curacao's port at the time Bradley was last seen. Her family realized she was missing between approximately 6:00 and 6:30 a.m. The sliding glass door to the balcony was partway open and a pair of Bradley's sandals were found inside of her suite, but there was no other sign of her. She had brought nine other pairs of shoes with her on the trip. She has never been seen again.

Bradley's parents stated that they asked the ship's staff not to let anyone off the ship once they realized she was missing, but the staff lowered the gangplank anyway. The family searched Curacao for signs of her but turned up nothing.

Authorities are not certain if Bradley went ashore on Curacao of her own will and vanished while in port or if other factors were at work. A cab driver later stated that she approached his cab and said she urgently needed a phone, but this sighting has not been confirmed.

Her family believes that Bradley was coerced by unknown person(s) whom she befriended during the cruise and abducted. There are rumors of maritime pirates operating out of Curacao and Bradley's loved ones believe that she may have become a victim of the individuals.

Bradley was last seen in the ship's elevator with ""Yellow,"" a member of the cruise ship's band, Blue Orchid. It is not known if this person was involved in Bradley's disappearance; there have been no arrests made in her case. Bradley also spent time with various waiters while on the cruise.

Authorities do not believe that Bradley fell overboard, as Rhapsody of the Seas was extremely close to shore at the time of her disappearance. Witnesses would have undoubtedly heard or seen any accident. Bradley was also a strong swimmer and a trained lifeguard, and in any case her body was not found when the water was searched.

Investigators also determined that it is very unlikely Bradley chose to disappear of her own accord. She was a recent college graduate with a degree in physical education and was planning to start a new job at a computer consulting firm after returning from the cruise.

There were possible sightings of Bradley on Curacao in August 1998 and January 1999. The witnesses in the 1998 sighting accurately described her tattoos and the witness in the 1999 sighting said she identified herself by name and asked for help. Bradley's parents therefore believe the sightings are authentic.

In March of 2005, a woman resembling Bradley was seen in Barbados. Sketches of the unidentified woman and her male companion are posted with this case summary. The Barbados woman has not been conclusively identified as Bradley.

Authorities believe two men may have information about Bradley's disappearance; sketches of both subjects are posted with this case summary. One of the men is described as Caucasian, in his late thirties or early forties, between 5'11 and 6'0 tall, with a receding hairline, red hair and a red beard. The other man was in his early thirties, approximately 5'11 tall with dark, curly shoulder-length hair. Neither person has been identified.

Bradley was a resident of Chesterfield County, Virginia at the time of her 1998 disappearance. She attended college in Longwood, Virginia on a basketball scholarship.

Bradley smoked Marlboro cigarettes at the time she was last seen. She enjoys drinking Coca-Cola and Miller Lite beer and eats hard candy. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, but there is no evidence to support the theory.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/1801

Samantha Ann Clarke,"September 13, 2010","Orange, Virginia",19,Caucasian / White,"5'1""",145 lbs,"Clarke was last seen in Orange, Virginia shortly after midnight on September 13, 2010.

She told her younger brother she was leaving and would be back in the morning. She left their home on Lindsey Drive, taking only her house key, and never returned. Her family reported her missing two days later. She has never been heard from again.

Randy Allen Taylor is considered a possible suspect in Clarke's disappearance. They knew each other, and they spoke on the phone on the day she vanished.

In August 2013, Taylor was charged with abducting Alexis Murphy, who disappeared on August 3. In January 2014, he was also charged with first-degree murder in her case. He was convicted in May. Alexis's body has never been located.

Taylor hasn't been charged in Clarke's case and it's unclear whether he was involved. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary.

Clarke graduated from Orange County High School three months before she went missing. She has no cellular phone or driver's license, and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. She had left her home once before and gone to stay in a nearby town for two weeks, but she kept in daily contact with her family by phone.

She bought a newspaper and a snack that day, and was seen walking past the local high school at 8:00 p.m. This is the last sighting of her. She has never been heard from again.

Banwell is from the New York City borough of Queens and had moved to Purcellville with her son only five days before she was last seen. She is described as a very independent and physically healthy woman who hadn't wanted to move, and only did so because her family told her otherwise she'd have to go into a nursing home.

During her first five days in Purcellville, Banwell wandered off three times. The first time her son found her; the second time she asked a police officer for help. The third time, she was never found.

An extensive search turned up no sign of Banwell. Dogs tracked her scent up a rural road, over a bicycle path to another road before they lost the trail in a rural farming area. Authorities believe she may have been trying to return to New York.","http://charleyproject.org/case/agnes-banwell

Tammy Lynn Akers,"February 7, 1977","Roanoke, Virginia",14,White/Caucasian,"5'4""",82 lbs,"Tammy and her friend, Angela Rader, were dropped off at William Ruffner Junior High School by one of the girls' relatives on February 7, 1977 in Roanoke, Virginia. The girls did not attend classes that day and were last seen hitchhiking in the city. Neither girl has been heard from again.

Angela and Tammy had run away together several times before their disappearances in 1977. The police originally did not take their disappearances seriously as a result.

Several months after their disappearances, one of the girls's mothers got a phone call from someone saying she was her daughter and was all right. Tammy and Angela were also allegedly seen in a grocery store in the months after they vanished but that sighting was never confirmed.

The girls' mothers told authorities that Tammy and Angela worked for a friend of their families, Earl Conrad Bramblett, in 1977. A photo of Bramblett is posted with this case summary.

Tammy's mother stated that her daughter was friends with Bramblett and his wife at the time, frequently spending time at their home. He did not seem to have any adult friends, just children.

Investigators believe that Bramblett may have been involved in Tammy and Angela's disappearances. He reportedly told friends at a party in 1980 that he wished he did not ""hurt Tammy"" back in 1977.

Bramblett was charged with molesting a ten-year-old girl in 1984 but acquitted. Tammy's older sister says he molested her when she was twelve years old and she believes he molested Tammy as well.

Bramblett convicted of murdering a Virginia family of four, Blaine and Teresa Hodges and their two children, in 1994 and sentenced to death. He was living with the Hodges family at the time of their homicides.

A jailhouse informant told police that Bramblett had told him that he killed the Hodges family after being caught molesting one of the children. The informant later recanted his statements, but Bramblett was executed in April 2003, still maintaining his innocence.

It's worth noting that Bramblett has many supporters (particularly online) who believe he was wrongly accused. The same people maintain that both Tammy and Angela ran away from Roanoke voluntarily in 1977.

Eight months after Bramblett was sent to death row, authorities dug up the yard of the house he had been living in when Tammy and Angela disappeared. They found nothing and the residence's current owners did not give them permission to search inside the house, so they never had the opportunity to look in the basement where they believe Tammy and Angela may be buried.

Bramblett always maintained his innocence in the missing girls' cases. He said he was drunk when he made the statement about ""hurting Tammy"" in 1980 and his comment was misinterpreted. He said he believes Tammy died in a bonfire in central Florida in 1980 and the police know about it and have tried to cover it up. There is no evidence to support Bramblett's theory, however.

Authorities never charged Bramblett in connection with the girls' disappearances. They have taken blood samples from the girls' mothers so if their bodies are found and their family members are all dead, the bodies can still be identified from DNA.

Angela's mother has since died; she believed her daughter was still alive. Tammy's family believes she is deceased and Bramblett was connected to her disappearance.

Tammy's and Angela's cases remain open and unsolved.

Joan Renee Cook,"January 24, 2010","Salem, Virginia",44,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",120 lbs,"Joan was last seen walking away from her husband's home on Elderwood Road in Salem, Virginia at 11:00 p.m. on January 24, 2010. She was en route to a friend's house, but the friend wasn't home at the time and it's unclear whether she ever ever arrived there.

Joan had been married for 22 years by the time she went missing, but her marriage was troubled and she and her husband, Mike, were separated. Mike had initially moved to Iowa in 2007 to find a job, with the plan being for his wife and daughter to join him there later. Joan began seeing another man while her husband was gone, and when Mike found out he returned to Virginia. According to Joan's sister, Mike stalked Joan and her boyfriend, but didn't actually make threats against them.

By the time she disappeared, Joan was living with her boyfriend and planned to divorce Mike when finances allowed. Her boyfriend had visitation with his daughter every other weekend, and during those times Joan would stay with her husband and their daughter. It was on one of the visitation weekends, while Joan was with her husband, that she disappeared. Mike said Joan behaved normally that night before leaving the house at 11:00 p.m. and never coming back.

The last contact with her was a cellular phone text message sent to the friend she was supposedly going to see the night of her disappearance, sent at at 5:00 a.m. on January 26. The text simply said ""I love you."" At the time, Joan was at the third Salem exit southbound on Interstate-81. Mike reported her missing on January 31.

A search of Mike's home turned up no evidence of foul play, and the couple's daughter, then seven years old, said she hadn't heard anything unusual that night. Mike took the child and moved back to Iowa after Joan went missing. Joan's boyfriend was ruled out as a suspect in her case because he was visiting his daughter out of town that weekend.

It's uncharacteristic of Joan to leave without warning and abandon her young daughter. She was carrying a purse, wallet, house keys, a green duffel bag containing clothes and makeup, and a beige toiletries bag at the time of her disappearance. Since she went missing, her cellular phone and bank accounts have not been used.

Hattie Gertrude Brown,"May 16, 2009","Halifax County, Virginia",48,African American / Black,"5'4""",155 lbs,"Hattie picked her adult nephew, Derek Edward Brown, up at a Sheetz gas station at the intersection of Route 501 and Route 58 in Halifax County, Virginia on May 16, 2009. She and her vehicle, a brown 2003 Volkswagen Jetta with the Virginia license plate number DV 20505, were captured on the station's security camera at 2:33 a.m.

Hattie dropped Derek off at a party and was last seen idling in her car outside. Derek made it home safely, but his aunt has never been heard from again.

In July, two months after Hattie's disappearance, her car was found abandoned and burned on a farm in southeastern Halifax County. It had been completely destroyed by the fire and looked as if it had been parked at the location for a long time. Authorities said the farm was abandoned, which suggested a local person was involved in Hattie's disappearance, since a local would be aware that it would be a safe place to leave her car where it wouldn't be found for some time.

After the vehicle's discovery, police publicly named Derek as a suspect in his aunt's disappearance. He hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with it, however. Derek has a prior criminal record for breaking and entering, destroying property and possession of burglary tools.

Hattie's family stated they didn't believe she left of her own accord, as this is uncharacteristic of her behavior. She left her purse and medication behind, as well as her cherished pet Chihuahua, when she vanished, and none of her accounts have been touched.

Hattie is an Army veteran who participated in Operation Desert Storm; she retired in 1998, with the rank of sergeant. She has eleven siblings, several of whom have died in the years since her disappearance.

Curiously, Hattie isn't the only missing person in her family; her brother, James Brown Jr., disappeared from Clover, Virginia in 2013. The cases aren't thought to be connected and both remain unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/11623

Rebecca Ann Crist,"May 3, 1988","Staunton, Virginia",25,Caucasian / White,"5'0""",115 lbs,"ist was last seen shortly after lunchtime on May 3, 1988 after she left her apartment on west Beverley Street in Staunton, Virginia. She was at home with her sister when she got a phone call, had a short conversation, and asked her sister to babysit her two-year-old son while she went out for a few minutes.

She was last seen walking westbound on west Beverly Street. She never returned and has never been heard from again.

The phone in Crist's apartment rang at about midnight the day she vanished, and Crist's mother answered, but the caller didn't say anything and the line went dead. Her family reported her missing on May 7.

In 1991, a handyman in Staunton sent a letter to Crist's family in which he confessed to accidentally killing her and disposing of her body in a landfill. Investigators were never able to verify his confession, but he remains a suspect in Crist's disappearance. He is currently incarcerated on unrelated charges.

An acquaintance and former neighbor of Crist's, Raymond Fauber, disappeared a few months after she did. Fauber was a retired postal worker. In 1991, his body was recovered from the basement of his home in the 300 block of Fayette Street; he'd been shot by his son-in-law, Robert Asbury, who was ultimately sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Cadaver dogs at the property followed a scent to the end of the paved driveway, leading police to theorize there was another body buried on the property. In the end, they decided not to search it, however.

Authorities don't believe Fauber's murder and Crist's disappearance are connected, and noted that his driveway had been paved several years before Crist disappeared. They also offered Asbury a plea deal where, if he confessed to Crist's murder, he would serve no additional prison time in her death; he maintained his innocence in her case.

Investigators are not certain what happened to Crist. She was well-liked in the community and had no known enemies, nor had she mentioned feeling unsafe or unhappy with her life prior to her disappearance.

She had dropped out of high school, didn't own a car or have a driver's license, and was on public assistance at the time of her disappearance, but she hadn't gotten in trouble with the law, didn't drink or smoke and didn't associate with people who did. Her sister stated she was very interested in police work and had a scanner and a scrapbook filled with newspaper clippings about the local police department.

At the time she vanished, it was believed Crist left of her own accord, but it would be highly unusual for her to have stayed out of contact with her family for so long. She also left her wallet behind, and she'd paid her rent a month in advance the day before she went missing.

She is described as a devoted parent who would not have willingly abandoned her son. She disappeared the day before she was due to appear in court for a paternity hearing about her son. Crist's parents are dead, but her sister and her son are still alive.

Crist's case remains unsolved; she is missing under unknown circumstances.

Curry attended Green Run High School, but didn't graduate. She got into some trouble as a teenager and, after her disappearance, she was charged with drug possession.

Her baby daughter was in foster care and she was trying to get the child returned to her care. Curry's loved ones don't believe she left on her own, because she was focused on getting her daughter back.

Curry's family members are concerned for her well-being. They believe she may have suffered a seizure or some other sort of trauma, possibly resulting in loss of memory.

She worked the closing shift at a Hardee's restaurant in the 600 block of Railroad Avenue west. Her 18-year-old boyfriend, Derek Maner, was supposed to pick her up after work, but he never did, so Erica's cousin gave her a ride. While they were driving, they passed Maner and pulled over in front of the county courthouse, and Erica got in Maner's car and they drove away.

They allegedly got into an argument in the vehicle; Maner later stated she accused him of infidelity. Maner said he offered to drive Erica to meet the woman he was accused of being involved with, in order to prove his innocence, and while they were on their way there, Erica suddenly jumped out of the car and ran into the woods adjacent to Highway 125, four miles from home. Maner said he stopped his car and searched for her, but was unable to find her and assumed she had gone home. She had not, however, and has never been heard from again.

A photograph of Maner is posted with this case summary. He and Erica have a son who was five months old in November 2006. At the time of her disappearance, Erica lived with Maner rather than with her parents, and Maner waited two days to tell them she was missing.

Police conducted an extensive search in the wooded area where Maner said he last saw Erica. They found her shoes, clothing and some pieces of her hair extensions, but no indication of her whereabouts. Cadaver dogs did not detect the smell of a dead body in the area.

Authorities never believed Erica left of her own accord. She is described as responsible, had a close and loving relationship with her parents and siblings, and does not fit the usual profile of a teen runaway. She was a good student and had dreams of going to college, and her parents stated she would have never abandoned her child.

After Erica's disappearance, Maner's car was subjected to forensic testing. Erica's blood, hair and tissue were found on the underside of the vehicle, along with evidence that someone tried to wash it off. Investigators believe she was run over at some point.

In April 2008, Maner was arrested and charged with murdering Erica. He had been considered the prime suspect in her disappearance from the outset of the investigation. Maner maintained his innocence at trial in February 2009. He said he didn't harm Erica and had no idea what happened to her, and that the blood and tissue on his car were from a dog he hit. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Foul play is suspected in Erica's case due to the circumstances involved. Her remains have never been recovered.","http://charleyproject.org/case/erica-monique-bradley

Shakeima Ann Cabbagestalk,"July 22, 1993","Dillon, South Carolina",10,African American / Black,"3'6""",65 lbs,"Shakeima was last seen in Dillon, South Carolina on July 22, 1993. Her stepfather, Sam Harmon, was the last person to see her. He left with her to go to the Turning Point Grocery on south First Avenue. Harmon says he left both Shakeima and her brother at the store. She has never been heard from again.

In August 2005, twelve years after Shakeima's disappearance, Harmon was charged with murder, two counts of kidnapping, and criminal sexual conduct with a minor in connection with her case. Prosecutors originally sought the death penalty against him, but later stopped pursuing that and sought life in prison instead. They also elected not to pursue the sex charge.

A photograph of Harmon is posted with this case summary. In 1992, Shakeima had accused him of touching her inappropriately. The state Department of Social Services investigated her claims, but her story changed several times and there was no evidence to support it, so no charges were filed against her stepfather. Investigators theorized Shakeima's allegations against Harmon gave him the motive to kill her.

Several of Shakeima's relatives testified at Harmon's October 2008 trial. Her uncle said that two weeks before Shakeima disappeared, Harmon had told him about ways he could dispose of a dead body. Prosecutors said Shakeima was very close to her brother and grandmother and would have contacted them if she could have.

There was no physical evidence to indicate she was dead, and Harmon maintained his innocence in her disappearance. He was acquitted of murder, but convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to twelve years in prison. He will become eligible for parole in 2011.

Foul play is suspected in Shakeima's case due to the circumstances involved, but several of her relatives believe she is still alive. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/5906

Elizabeth W. Calvert,"March 3, 2008","Hilton Head Island, South Carolina",45,Caucasian / White,"5'4"" - 5'6""
",120 lbs,"Elizabeth and her husband, John, were last seen on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina at 5:30 p.m. on March 3, 2008. They lived part-time on their 40-foot yacht, the Yellow Jacket, which was docked at the Harbour Town marina. They also owned a home in the Brookhaven neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.

Elizabeth worked as an attorney with the Hunter MacLean law firm in Savannah, Georgia, specializing in employee benefits and executive compensation. She had been with them for about a year; she previously worked for the United Parcel Service (UPS). John owned four Hilton Head Island businesses, including one that operated the marina, one that owned 125 rental properties, and two boating companies.

Both Calverts were prominent and well-liked members of the local community. They kept in close touch with their family and friends and both of them kept regular routines. It is highly uncharacteristic of them to leave without warning.

Elizabeth and John were reported missing on March 4, after they both missed business appointments. Their cellular phones and PDA devices have been turned off since their disappearances, which is uncharacteristic of them. Prior to vanishing, the Calverts had placed their pet dog in an Atlanta kennel. Their pet cat was found on the yacht.

Elizabeth received her pilot's license in 2006 and owns a small single-engine plane, which was found undisturbed on the tarmac at the island's airport after her disappearance. Several days after the disappearance, a dive team searched the marina, but the search turned up no evidence.

Authorities initially couldn't locate one of the couple's three cars, a silver 2006 Mercedes E-320 with Georgia license plates numbered GT-821B. Several days later, it was found in the parking lot of the Marriott hotel in the Palmetto Dunes resort, a gated community six miles from the Harbour Town marina. There were no clues as to the Calverts' whereabouts inside the vehicle. They didn't own or lease any property at the resort.

Dennis Ray Gerwing was the last person known to have seen Elizabeth and John together. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. A certified public accountant (CPA), he was the chief financial officer of The Club Group, a realty group that manages property on Hilton Head Island. John had hired the group to do administrative, accounting and other services for his commercial properties.

In December 2007, John decided to end their business relationship with The Club Group and Gerwing was leading the transfer of services. He refused to cooperate with the police investigation. Several days after the Calverts disappeared, police executed search warrants on his home, office and two of his vehicles.

On March 11, Gerwing's lawyer found his body and two suicide notes locked in the bathroom of his condominium. He had lined his bathtub with a comforter and pillows and then slashed his inner thigh, his neck and his left forearm a steak knife. The time of death was approximately 4:00 a.m. on March 10, several hours before he was publicly named as a person of interest in the Calverts' disappearances.

Police described the suicide notes as nearly illegible, rambling and not very lucid. In the notes Gerwing admitted he stole money from the Calverts' businesses, but didn't say whether he was involved in their disappearances. Elizabeth and John had allegedly planned to confront them about the missing money at the March 3 meeting. One of their friends said he believed they probably would not have pressed charges but merely permitted Gerwing, who was himself wealthy, to simply repay any money he'd taken.

After his death, The Club Group was audited and they discovered Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 from the Calverts' company and seven other companies, depositing the money in a secret account.

Gerwing purchased latex gloves and three large, heavyweight drop cloths after his meeting with the Calverts. When investigators searched his home, they found the holster for his .22 caliber Beretta pistol, but not the gun itself. Authorities consider him the prime suspect in the Calverts' disappearances. They think John and Elizabeth's bodies are buried hundreds of miles from Hilton Head, possibly along a dirt road.

Elizabeth is a graduate of Converse College and the University of Georgia law school. She sat on Converse College's board of trustees at the time of her disappearance. John graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in mechanical engineering. The Calverts married in 1988. They are childless and seemed to have a good marriage. Both of them were declared legally dead in November 2009. Foul play is suspected in their disappearances, which remain unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/elizabeth-w-calvert,-80.7667845,32.1559963

The first indicated that she was going downtown, another that she would be out with a friend named Miguel(of whom her family had never heard). The last message said she planned to return to Mexico, her native country. Her family doesn't think she sent the text messages, as she did not normally communicate via text messages.

She has never been heard from again. She left behind her cellular phone, wallet, all her clothes and other belongings.

A family member wired her $100 on the day of her disappearance so she could go shopping, but she never picked up the money. Since Bell's disappearance she hasn't been active on her social media accounts and hasn't contacted her family, which is uncharacteristic of her behavior.

There were possible sightings of Bell at a motel after her disappearance. She may be in Charlotte or Fayetteville, North Carolina or in Atlanta, Georgia. Bell's loved ones stated she would not have accepted a ride from a stranger or someone she didn't trust. Her family believes she may not have left voluntarily and, if she did, someone or something may be preventing her from returning home; they are concerned for her safety.

Bell was a student at Phoenix Academy on Flint Street at the time of her disappearance; it's a non-traditional high school with a flexible schedule that offers online classes as well as face-to-face instruction twice a week. She attended school on the day of her disappearance. She planned to become a hairsylist after graduation. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/28145

She told her son she was going to visit a friend at approximately 10:30 p.m., shortly after her phone conversation ended. She never returned home.

Crawford's friend told authorities that Crawford never arrived at her residence that evening. Two witnesses believe they saw her with an unidentified Caucasian male outside of the Ingles in Simpsonville on July 18, two days after she disappeared. She has never been heard from again.

Crawford's burgundy and white or blue and white two-door 1978 Chevrolet Malibu was found abandoned at the Fountain Inn parking lot on Georgia Street in Simpsonville on July 19, 1986, in front of Wilson Sporting Goods. This is about six miles from where she was last seen. The vehicle had been wiped clean of prints and the driver's seat was pushed all the way back; Crawford drove with it pushed forward.

At the time of her disappearance, Crawford was dealing with financial problems and she may have been depressed. Since she went missing there hasn't been any activity on her Social Security number.

",105 lbs,"Sarah was last seen with her daughter, Kimberly, and her friend, Linda McCord. The three of them attended a gospel concert in Waltersboro, South Carolina on the evening of April 3, 1987. They were driving through Dorchester County, South Carolina en route to their residences in Orangeburg County when they disappeared.

A witness saw their blue Lincoln driving between 30 and 45 miles per hour around Route 15. Another car was behind it, but the witness was unable to describe the second vehicle or its occupant(s).

Sarah's husband, Phillip J. Boyd, returned home from work at midnight. He was initially unconcerned about his wife and daughter's absence because he thought they were with other relatives or with McCord. When Sarah and Kimberly hadn't returned by 6:00 a.m. the next day, Phillip notified the police.

The vehicle in which the Boyds and McCord were traveling was located disabled and abandoned in Dorchester County near the intersection of Highway 15 and 176 on April 5. McCord's husband found it. A freeze plug had blown out and the engine had overheated. There was no sign of the three females at the scene and they have never been heard from again.

Sarah's credit card was used in a local mall in 1990, three years after her disappearance. Police stated the signature was barely legible and didn't match Sarah's writing. The identity of the credit card user has never been established. Foul play is suspected in McCord and the Boyds' disappearances.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/23977

Monica Renee Bowie,"July 5, 2007","Atlanta, Georgia",34,African American / Black,"5'4""",135 lbs,"Bowie was last seen at Lenox Apartments where she lived in the 2100 block of Gables Drive northeast in Atlanta, Georgia. She was abducted from the parking lot. Five witnesses heard a woman scream for help at 11:00 or 11:15 p.m. and then saw a maroon 2002 Mercury Sable driving off. Inside the vehicle were two men in their late twenties or early thirties. One of the men was heavyset and bearded.

One of the witnesses memorized the car license plate number and called 911. Police found items including a woman's green jacket, jewelry, a manila folder, a broken perfume bottle, a container of chicken wings, eyeglasses and two broken fingernails scattered in the parking lot. The car seen leaving the scene was located the next day, abandoned and burned. It was badly damaged.

On July 7, Authorities arrested Jasper Keels and charged him with the theft of the car. He had borrowed it from an acquaintance on July 4 and never returned it. A photograph of Keels is posted with this case summary.

On June 20, two weeks prior to her disappearance, Bowie and her fiance, Shernotta ""Rico"" Walters, were arrested on felony charges after the police found marijuana and a handgun in her vehicle. Walters was driving; he had borrowed the vehicle from Bowie. Bowie had no prior criminal history and maintained she had no idea how the drugs and gun got in her car.

The charges against both of them were eventually dropped, but Walters was jailed because he was on parole and possession of a gun constituted a violation. (He had served time on drug charges two years earlier.) He was still incarcerated on the day she disappeared. Authorities questioned him about Bowie's abduction, but he is not being called a suspect and her family does not believe he was involved.

It is unclear whether the criminal case is connected to Bowie's abduction. She has no prior criminal history. She and Walters planned to get married on March 30, 2007.

Bowie had worked as an exotic dancer for a time after she moved to Atlanta from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1999, but only for a few months. At the time of her disappearance, her main source of income was from doing accounting for various clients. She also owned two businesses: Go2girls Promotions Inc., an event planning company, and LaCoca Wear Clothing, a clothing boutique. She met with her lawyer just hours before her disappearance; he says she was behaving normally and appeared to be in good spirits.

Keels was originally only charged with the theft of the abduction car and with drug possession, but in September 2007 he was also charged with Bowie's kidnapping. Investigators do not know whether he knew her, but they theorize the abduction was not a random act and was connected to illegal drug activity. They stated they expected to arrest other individuals in connection with the abduction. Bowie's body has not been located and no one has been charged with causing her death.

Bowie grew up in Pittsburgh with her mother stepfather and four siblings. She graduated from high school at Perry Traditional Academy, then got a bachelor's degree in accounting from Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, where she was class valedictorian. She remained close to her family in Pittsburgh even after she moved to Atlanta, and frequently came back to visit. Her disappearance remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/761

Edney was last seen walking out of her residence at Clanton Personal Care Home on Clanton Road in Augusta, Georgia at approximately 12:00 PM on May 11, 1992. She has never been heard from again. One witness reported seeing Edney walking on Georgia Highway 56 shortly after her disappearance, but this sighting was never confirmed. There have been various other reports regarding Edney's whereabouts throughout the years, but none of the leads have panned out. 
Edney's family believes that a driver stopped and picked Edney up the day of her disappearance. Foul play is not suspected in her case. Investigators believe that she may have died as a result of exposure to the elements. Edney's daughter stated that her mother did not want to return to the home after a visit elsewhere on the day of her disappearance. Her daughter promised to return after her work day ended, but Edney had already vanished by that time.

"NamUs #MP3986
Monica Renita Bennett","June 21, 1989","Brunswick, Georgia",15 Years,Black / African American,"5' 5""Ê",130 lbs,"Monica and her brother, Michael, were last seen at Heritage Apartments in the 5700 block of Altama Avenue in Brunswick, Georgia on June 21, 1989.

Their mother, Deborah George, and her husband, Robert L. George, were separated, and Michael and Monica were staying with other relatives: Monica with her biological father, and Michael with Robert's first wife and his half-siblings on his father's side. (Robert had still been married to his first wife when Michael was born, and Michael did not take his last name. Robert's first wife treated Michael very well and accepted him into the family. Later, Robert divorced his wife wife and married Deborah, and they had four daughters.)

There are reports that Monica and Michael were helping pack up Robert's apartment in preparation for his upcoming move to Alabama, and that they disappeared after he dropped them off at their mother's residence. However, according to the Bennett children's siblings, Robert's apartment was nearly empty at the time.

Monica was very close to her oldest sister, Shelia Wigfall. By 1989, Wigfall was no longer living at home, although she was still in high school at Glynn Academy, which Michael and Monica also attended. Wigfall was married, pregnant with her first child and living with her in-laws, but she and Monica spoke to each other every day at school.

Early in 1989, Monica had gone to Wigfall at school and said Robert had been sexually abusing her and she didn't want to go home. Wigfall took her to the school guidance counselor's office, and the guidance counselor took them to the police. When Deborah found out about her daughter's allegations, she told the police she didn't believe them and thought Monica was just making the stories up because she didn't want to live at home anymore. The matter was dropped without any follow-up from the authorities.

Even though years earlier Deborah had walked in on Robert sexually abusing her then thirteen-year-old sister, and even after one of Monica's sisters caught Robert trying to sneak into her room at night, Deborah refused to believe Robert was abusing Monica. Michael was very close to Robert and didn't believe Monica's allegations either, until late spring, he walked in on Robert molesting his sister.

Michael told Deborah what he'd seen, and this is when Deborah and Robert separated, Michael moved in with Robert's first wife, and Monica moved in with her biological father. (Little is known about Monica's father, but her family stated she would not have chosen to live with him except for lack of better options.) Robert and Deborah's other children stayed with Deborah and saw their father on weekends.

Michael and Monica disappeared weeks after Robert and Deborah's separation. Although he'd just gotten an apartment in Brunswick, Robert decided to move back to his home state of Alabama. By the day of Michael and Monica's disappearance, Robert's apartment was almost entirely packed up, with only some bedding and essentials still unpacked.

On the afternoon of June 21, Robert went to his ex-wife's house and told Michael to get in the car with him so Michael could help him pack. Michael didn't want to go with him and was crying when they left together. Robert then picked Monica up from her father's house, and they went to Robert's apartment complex.

The children's aunt also lived at the complex, across the courtyard from Robert's apartment, and Michael and Monica made a surprise visit to her before dark that evening and had something to eat at her apartment. When she walked them out at about 8:30 p.m., she saw Robert outside.

Michael and Monica walked away, and Robert spoke to the children's aunt and asked her to intercede with Deborah and get her to let him come home. The aunt called Deborah on a pay phone, and then Robert spoke to Deborah on the phone, as Monica and Michael walked up the hill ahead and out of sight. This is the last time anyone besides Robert saw them.

Robert later gave two different stories about his son and stepdaughter's disappearances: one was that they ran out of his apartment while he was there and never came back, and the second was that he dropped them off at the apartment and went away to run some errands, and when he returned they were gone.

(Curiously, the police report about Michael and Monica's disappearance said that Robert called Deborah at 8:30 p.m. to say the children were missing. Robert was speaking to Deborah on the phone at about that time, according to the children's aunt, but Monica and Michael were still within eyesight.)

According to Michael and Monica's younger sisters, later that evening Robert picked them up from their mother's home and drove in the streets around John's apartment complex slowly, looking around. He didn't call Michael or Monica's names or ask any passersby if they'd seen them. He then took the children to his apartment. One of the girls recalled that one of the beds at the apartment was missing its sheets and comforter, and she noticed two trash bags in the apartment by the front door, which Robert said contained Monica and Michael's belongings.

Within a few days, Robert's car disappeared; his children never found out what had happened to it. He and Deborah reconciled within a few weeks of Michael and Monica's disappearances, took their remaining children and moved to Alabama on a bus, leaving Wigfall behind in Georgia.

Many of Monica and Michael's relatives believe Robert was involved in their disappearances. Deborah's mother described him as a controlling, manipulative and violent husband who occasionally beat Deborah, and Michael and Monica's younger siblings also remember episodes of violent behavior by their father. After the move to Alabama, Deborah would occasionally leave her husband, but would always return to him. Often when she left, she would leave their children behind in his care.

Robert's brother has also been mentioned as possibly having been involved in Michael and Monica's cases, or at least knowing what happened to them. He had lived with the family off and on for years, and Robert had also lent him money. Wigfall stated he sexually abused her when she was young, and Deborah had warned the other children to stay away from him.

For decades after Michael and Monica disappeared, the police wrote them off as runaways; both Robert and Deborah said they had run away, and that Monica had a boyfriend who was involved with drugs. The police took reports for their disappearances but didn't actually investigate until the early 2000s, when the children were reclassified as ""endangered missing.""

The Bennett children didn't take any money or belongings when they disappeared, and there's been no record of their existence anywhere in the country since 1989. Foul play is now suspected in Michael and Monica's disappearances.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/3986?nav

Aida Ruth Calfee,"October 2, 1981","Dahlonega, Georgia",25,White / Caucasian,5'7 - 5'9,125 - 130 lbs,"Calfee was last seen in the company of her boyfriend, Jim Pruitt, on October 2, 1981. They had decided to cancel a fishing trip they'd planned. She allegedly got out of the car near the town square in Dahlonega, Georgia, refused to get back in, and to hitchhike home. She was seen heading south on Highway 19 and 41.

Calfee had accused Pruitt of assaulting her earlier in 1981; she said he beat and choked her and shoved her down a flight of stairs at their apartment complex in Marietta, Georgia in July. She told authorities he had beaten her before and once broken her wrist, but she had not reported him before then because she was afraid. She said Pruitt was trying to get her to drop the charges against him. She disappeared five days before his arraignment.

At Pruitt's trial for assaulting Calfee, he testified and admitted he'd wrapped his tie around her neck during their argument ""to scare her, to get her to stop."" He was found guilty of misdemeanor battery.

Since Calfee disappeared, her credit cards and bank accounts have not been used. She worked as a secretary at a brokerage firm in Atlanta, Georgia in 1981, and her family stated it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/1300?nav

Long resided at her former stepfather's residence on Ashland Drive in the Bloomfield area of Macon, Georgia. Long was born in Memphis, Tennessee, but grew up in Macon. 
On August 13, 1991, Long worked her second shift job at Bibb Manufacturing. She got off work at 11 p.m. and stopped by her boyfriend's to trade cars - she'd been driving his Camaro because her truck was having problems. The boyfriend drove her home and left. Long phoned her mother between 12:30 AM and 1:30 AM. She said she was going to visit a neighbor. 
Long's stepfather returned home at approximately 3:00 AM. The lights were on inside and Long's truck was in the driveway, but Long wasn't there. 
Long's boyfriend arrived at her stepfather's home during the morning hours of August 15, looking for her. A call to Bibb Manufacturing revealed Sabrina hadn't called or shown up for work Wednesday. She also hadn't picked up her paycheck. Her work clothes from Tuesday were on the floor of her bedroom. Her purse and makeup were in the house. Her neighbor said that she never had plans to visit his house on August 14. 
Long's mother said that her daughter received several obscene phone calls prior to her disappearance. Long scheduled an interview with a local company during the summer of 1991 and was excited about the possibility of working there. Her mother said that Long learned an appointment had never been scheduled when she called to confirm the time shortly afterwards. 
There were rumors that Long had a secret boyfriend who lived near Lake Tobesofkee who might have picked her up. No evidence has been located to substantiate the rumors.

Geise was last seen at her place of work, a picture frame company in Norcross, Georgia, on February 26, 1989. It was her day off, but she had gone there to run inventory. That same day, someone started a fire at the company. The fire triggered the sprinkler system, but the sprinkers were not connected to an alarm, so the water poured for hours without being detected. When employees arrived the following morning, the water was ankle-deep on the floor. Near Geise's desk, where the fire had started, was a pool of blood. 
Due to the circumstances, authorities began searching for Geise immediately. Her purse was found on the roof of a nearby building; nothing was missing except the keys to Geise's car, a 1983 Nissan Pulsar. The vehicle was found parked a block away. In the woods near Geise's workplace was a 10-pound doorstop and a cloth mail card, both stained with blood. Some bloodstains were also found on the door of a company van. There was no sign of Geise or her remains. Authorities attempted to test the blood at her work site for DNA, but the water had destroyed the DNA in the blood. It had been raining the day Geise disappeared and the bloodstained items outside got wet.

Investigators interviewed him at least ten times, but Lucas consistently denied involvement in Bishop's disappearance.

Lucas was convicted of the 1979 murder of an unidentified female in Texas and sentenced to death. The state's former governor, George W. Bush, commuted his sentence to life imprisonment prior to Lucas's scheduled 1999 execution. He later died in prison. Lucas claimed to have killed approximately 600 people, but he confessed to many crimes he did not commit and the exact number of his victims is unknown.

Monica Lynn Appleton,"October 13, 1999","Pampa, Texas",29,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",100 - 111 lbs,"Appleton was last seen by her mother at approximately 5:00 p.m. on October 13, 1999 in in the vicinity of the 100 block of northeast 9th Avenue in northwest Amarillo, Texas. Appleton's mother said her daughter appeared to be frightened about something, but refused say what was disturbing her, or to accompany her mother back to their family's residence in Pampa, Texas. Appleton has never been heard from again. Her relatives reported her missing from their home in Pampa in November 1999.

Appleton was last known to be in the company of Ivory Tealer, also known as T and/or T-Baby. When he was interviewed by investigators, Tealer stated that he did not know Appleton's whereabouts. He has since refused to speak any further about to the police about her disappearance.

Appleton left behind her son and daughter, which her loved ones said is extremely uncharacteristic of her. She had been divorced from her husband for about a year prior to her disappearance, and her children lived with her mother. She saw them regularly prior to going missing, but has not had contact with them since she vanished. She has also not picked up her child support checks from her ex-husband; he stopped paying support less than a year after Appleton disappeared.

Appleton's mother received a phone call from an unidentified man on August 20, 2000. The individual claimed that he was a gang member and witnessed Appleton's alleged murder at a hog farm in Amarillo, Texas shortly after her disappearance. He said that another member killed Appleton, then disposed of her remains at the farm. The individual claimed that her body would never be located. The man terminated the call before Appleton's mother could learn additional details. The information he provided has never been confirmed and no supporting evidence has been located.

Appleton's brother, a law enforcement officer in the Pampa area, told reporters that he learned his sister may have been involved with gang members, prostitution and the drug culture in 1999. Appleton frequently visited the Amarillo area at the time. Her brother stated that it would be uncharacteristic of Appleton to leave her children without warning. She may have traveled to El Paso, Texas; Houston, Texas; or Baltimore, Maryland after her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/904

Margarette Ann Cuauhtli,"October 11, 2001","Arlington, Texas",16,Hispanic / Latina and/or Asian,"5'5""",135 lbs,"Margarette was last seen inside her family's Arlington, Texas residence during the morning hours of October 11, 2001. She has never been heard from again. She was a senior at Sam Houston High School at the time of her disappearance.

Margarette's adoptive father, Gabriel Emilio Cuauhtli, reported her as a runaway. A photograph of Gabriel is posted with this case summary. Margarette's classification was changed from endangered runaway to endangered missing by the end of October 2001.

Gabriel claimed that his daughter was abducted by members of the Mexican Mafia and sold into prostitution. He said that men with shaved heads arrived at his home on Port Phillip Drive in Arlington and demanded ransom money in exchange for Margarette's release. Investigators stated that they believed Gabriel's version of events was fictitious.

Gabriel claimed that he received several e-mails from Margarette after her disappearance. He said that the messages were sent from Mexico between October 2001 and February 2002. A photo of Margarette and another girl posing in front of a Mexican church was allegedly attached to one of her e-mails.

Officials analyzed the image and determined that it was fraudulent. Authorities traced the e-mails and concluded that the messages had been sent from Gabriel's office computer. He was employed as a fraud investigator at Chase Bank on East Border Street at the time.

Gabriel was arrested on suspicion of abducting his daughter in April 2002. He was released shortly thereafter on bail. Margarette's uncle provided a 2001 videotaped statement by his niece, which included her allegations of abuse against her father.

Gabriel claimed that Margarette lied during the taping, and maintained his innocence in her disappearance. He insisted that he recorded telephone conversations with Margarette after October 2001 and handed the tapes over to authorities. Investigators denied that the recordings existed.

Authorities arrested Gabriel in June 2002 and charged him with evidence tampering and fraud. The latter charges stemmed from alleged embezzlement from Chase Bank and are unrelated to Margarette's disappearance.

Gabriel's wife, Margarette's mother Nannette Cuauhtli, supported him and stated that she never believed her husband had anything to do with their daughter's disappearance. Margarette's older brother testified that Margarette told him she wanted to run away because her father was physically and emotionally abusing her.

Gabriel was convicted of the embezzlement charges in May 2004. During the sentencing phase of his trial, he pleaded guilty to theft and tampering with evidence. The kidnapping charge was dropped as part of his plea agreement.

Gabriel is presently incarcerated. Authorities searched for Margarette's body at his former residence in 2006, digging under a concrete patio that was poured just days after her disappearance, but the search turned up no evidence. She remains missing and her case is unsolved.

Different sources say Margarette is Hispanic / Latina or Asian.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/5987

Jennifer Joyce Barton,"May 16, 1976","Austin, TX",20,Black/African American,"5'6""-5'8""",120-140 lbs,"Barton planned to go to the movies with a friend in Austin, Texas on May 16, 1976. She was short of cash and stopped at a bar in the vicinity of east 11th Street and Waller Street to see if she could get some money there. She met two African-American men inside the bar, and spent half an hour talking to them. One of them is described as 5'4 with a thin build, wearing a sailor's cap and a t-shirt. The other was 5'6 with a heavy build and a large Afro. Jennifer told a friend the men offered her $25 for sex.

She decided to go with them. One man left via the back door, and the other went out the front door and got into a large brown or tan van. It had a large whip antenna, teardrop-shaped side windows, a spare wheel on the back, and California license plates. The van turned the corner, and the second man got inside it.

One of Barton's friends was walking down the street at the time, and saw the van go around the block and come back up the street. She looked into the van, but didn't see Barton. Barton has never been heard from again.

Two other young African-American women, Debra Stewart and Brenda Moore, both disappeared from Austin in the spring of 1976, and it's possible the three cases are related. Stewart was not a prostitute, but she did frequent the 11th Street area, like Barton did, and the two women had friends and acquaintances in common.

Moore vanished on March 7, 1976; she was last seen at 3:15 p.m. on the east side of Austin. On March 12, her car was found abandoned in the 1900 block of Coleto Street, less than a block from where Stewart's vehicle was later located, with the car keys inside it.

Photographs of Moore are unavailable; she was 19 years old at the time of her disappearance and is described as 5'0 tall and 125 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. She worked as a nurse's aide and had a history of depression.

Moore was married at the time of her disappearance, but she and her husband had been separated for about four months and she had a boyfriend who drove a blue Chevrolet pickup truck. Her husband said he thought she had simply left town with another man. There is no hard evidence that Moore, Barton and Stewart's disappearances are connected, but police are looking into the possibility.

Barton was raised in an upper-middle-class family and was well-behaved as a child, but she dropped out of Reagan High School in her senior year and began dating a man who was a drug dealer and a pimp. After her boyfriend was imprisoned, she started using heroin and became a prostitute.

In February 1976, her pimp was murdered in a robbery gone bad at an Austin hotel. There were rumors that Barton had set him up, and she was afraid that his friends would come after her.

Shortly after the murder, Barton's apartment was broken into and vandalized; obscene pictures and words were painted in red on the wall and someone pinned her underwear to the wall and wrote ""blood"" nearby. It's unclear whether the murder of Barton's pimp and and the subsequent break-in at her apartment are connected to her later disappearance.

Barton had made comments about wanting to go to California, and police looked for her in the Los Angeles area, but their searches turned up nothing. She has a record for robbery, assault and prostitution, but she has not been arrested since her 1976 disappearance. She is considered endangered and foul play is suspected in her case.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/909

Prior to his arrest, he gave a media interview asserting his innocence; he stated Cowan owed him money and he believed she had left of her own volition. In July 2007, Negri was convicted of murder and sentenced to serve 20 years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine.

There was a pool of blood on the rear passenger-side floorboard, and plastic sheeting in the trunk was covered with dried blood and hair.

Police found inconsistencies in Cyphers's story about the events of that night. They searched his home in the 6800 block of Montana in Austin and found blood there; they think a violent crime occurred and someone made attempts to clean up. The search also uncovered an April 3 receipt with a list of ""suspicious"" items purchased from a Wal-Mart store. Police determined through cell phone records that Cyphers, Gibson and Taylor were all at his home at 3:00 a.m. on April 2. At 7:30 a.m., the three phones left Austin together and traveled to Houston. Cyphers's phone was used to make multiple calls to Megabus, a commercial bus line with a pickup location within walking distance of where Taylor's car was found. Starting at 5:00 p.m., Cyphers's phone traveled without Gibson's and Taylor's phones along the same route Megabus takes between Houston and Austin.

Gibson was the single parent of an eight-year-old son at the time of her disappearance, and had a steady job in Houston. It's uncharacteristic of either her or Taylor to leave without warning or abandon their families. Foul play is suspected in their cases, which remain unsolved.

Monica Cassandra Carrasco,"October 2, 2003","Balmorhea, Texas",16,Hispanic / Latina,"5'5""",100 lbs - 111 lbs,"October 2, 2003:
Monica was last seen at her aunt and uncle's home four miles east of Balmorhea, Texas in the early morning hours of October 2, 2003. Two cousins saw her go to bed at 11:00 p.m. the night before. They checked on her at 1:30 a.m. and she was in bed asleep. By 7:30 a.m., however, she was gone, and her Bible had disappeared with her.

Extensive searches of the area around Monica's aunt and uncle's home have yielded no clues as to her whereabouts. The terrain is rugged with many rocks, thorns and cactuses, and would have been painful to walk in without shoes. Monica may have left the Balmorhea area to meet someone, possibly an individual she contacted through the Internet. Her aunt and uncle believe she may have become disoriented from her medications, left the house, and gotten a ride with a passing motorist, possibly on Highway 17 which runs near their home.

A bus driver allegedly harassed Monica in May 2003, five months before her disappearance. She did not report the incident to any official authority, but was so shaken by it that she refused to take the bus to school after that. The bus driver was interviewed and has been ruled out as a suspect in her disappearance, but Monica's uncle failed a lie detector test in relation to her case.

While Monica apparently left the house of her own accord, police believe she may be in danger. She became depressed following her father's death from bone cancer in 2000 and was hospitalized for the depression and anorexia nervosa after losing over fifty pounds. After she was released from the hospital, she decided to live with her aunt and uncle because she was angry with her mother. Monica's mother says their relationship problems were not serious, however, and she does not believe her daughter ran away.

Monica was a junior at Alpine High School at the time of her disappearance and is described as a very religious person. Her case remains unsolved.

Marjorie Croude McKinley Chillingworth,"June 14, 1955","West Palm Beach, Florida",56,Caucasian / White,,,"Marjorie was last seen with her husband, Curtis, at a dinner in West Palm Beach, Florida on June 14, 1955. They left the dinner at approximately 10:00 p.m. to return to their home in the 200 block of Dyer Road in Manalapan, Florida. Neither of the Chillingworths have been heard from again.

Curtis and Marjorie had hired a carpenter to build a playground for their grandchildren at their home. The carpenter arrived as scheduled at 8:00 a.m. on June 15 and found the house deserted and the door open. Curtis was scheduled to preside over a hearing in West Palm Beach at 10:00 a.m., but never arrived.

Authorities went to search the Chillingworth residence at noon. The porch light was shattered and there were blood drops on the walkway to the beach. Two used spools of adhesive tape were located, one on the beach and one in the living room.

The Chillingworths' swimming suits were left behind, as was some cash. Curtis's Plymouth was located at the residence with the keys still it in the ignition.

An extensive search turned up no sign of either Curtis or Marjorie. They were declared legally dead in 1957 and were given a headstone in Oak Lawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach.

In 1960, Joseph Alexander Peel Jr. was charged with murdering the Chillingworths. He was the municipal judge for West Palm Beach in 1955, and noted for his corruption and incompetence.

Curtis was the senior circuit judge of Palm Beach County and Peel's superior; he had gotten the job at age 26, the youngest person in Florida history to do so. Curtis had warned Peel several times about his judicial misconduct.

In 1953, after Peel represented both sides in a divorce case, Curtis told him it was his last chance and he would face disciplinary action next time. In retaliation, Peel ordered Floyd Albert ""Lucky"" Holzapfel to kill the Chillingworths. Photographs of Peel and Holzapfel are posted with this case summary.

Holzapfel confessed to the Chillingworths' murders in 1960. He stated he and a friend, George David ""Bobby"" Lincoln, had killed Curtis and Marjorie together. A photograph of Lincoln is posted with this case summary. Holzapfel and Peel were both arrested after the confession.

Lincoln was already incarcerated in a federal prison on unrelated charges by 1960. He was granted immunity from prosecution for the murders in return for agreeing to testify as a witness. Holzapfel pleaded guilty to both murders and agreed to testify against Peel. He was sentenced to death.

At Peel's trial, Lincoln and Holzapfel stated they had taken Curtis and Marjorie out into the ocean on a boat, taped their hands, strapped lead weights to their bodies and threw them overboard, still alive.

Curtis was still able to swim in spite of his taped hands and the weights. Lincoln and Holzapfel hit him with a shotgun, but he continued to float. They had to pull him back onto the board and put an additional weight on him before he sank. Lincoln and Holzapfel stated they had not received payment from Peel for committing the murders.

Peel was convicted of being an accessory to Curtis's murder and pleaded no contest to his role in Marjorie's death. He served eighteen years in a Florida state prison, then was released in 1979 to serve a federal sentence in Missouri for an unrelated mail fraud conviction. He was paroled in 1981.

Peel was suffering from cancer by this time and died only nine days after his release from prison. Days before his death, he gave a newspaper interview wherein he stated he had not ordered the Chillingworths' murders, but he had been aware of them and had done nothing to stop them.

Holzapfel's death sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1966. He was a model prisoner and died in 1996, still incarcerated. Lincoln finished his federal prison term in 1962. He died in 2004.

Marjorie belonged to the local Garden Club in 1955 and had won awards for her gerbera flowers. She and Curtis had three children together.

Although their bodies were never recovered, foul play is suspected in their cases due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/marjorie-croude-mckinley-chillingworth,-80.0509143,26.6880176

Lillian Annette Anderson,"August 1, 1974","Jacksonville, Florida",11,Caucasian / White,"4'4""",61 lbs,"Annette and her sister, Mylette, disappeared from Jacksonville, Florida on August 1, 1974. Their mother and older sister left them alone at home at approximately 6:00 p.m., while she went to care for a sick relative. Their mother called them at 7:00 p.m. to check on the children and everything was normal during the conversation, but when their aunt called later, no one answered the phone.

The girls' father, a commercial fisherman, was supposed to arrive home from work at 7:00 p.m., but he got delayed by twenty minutes due to a faulty boat motor. When he did get home, Annette and Mylette were nowhere to be found.

Neighbors said they saw a white car in the driveway of the Anderson residence sometime during 6:00 and 7:00 p.m., but nobody saw anything suspicious and no one saw the girls leave. Nothing was missing from the house except a baby doll Mylette owned. The doors to the home were shut, but not locked, and there were no indications of forced entry. The family's small dog, which usually had the run of the house, was shut up in a bedroom. Mylette and Annette were never heard from again.

That year several young girls between six and twelve disappeared from the Jacksonville area. The first was Jean Marie Schoen. Virginia Suzanne Helm vanished on September 27, and Rebecca Ann Greene disappeared on October 12.

Virginia's partially clothed body was found in a shallow grave a month after her disappearance; she had been shot in the head. Rebecca's skeletal remains were found three years later, washed up on the shore of Little Fort George Island at the mouth of the St. Johns River. Both girls were twelve years old when they died. Jean's body and the Anderson sisters' remains were never found.

Because the abductions happened in different parts of the city, authorities don't believe they are related. One suspect in their cases was Paul John Knowles, a serial murderer who was killed by police later in 1974. A photo of him is posted below this case summary. Ima Sanders, whose body wasn't identified until 2011, is another presumed victim of his.

Knowles claimed he killed 35 victims. After his death, they found tape recordings where Knowles said he'd abducted two girls matching the description of the Anderson sisters, killed them and buried them in a remote area at the west end of Commonwealth Avenue. The children's father subsequently filed a wrongful death suit against his estate.

However, Knowles was known for inflating his number of victims, and the police now believe his confession was probably false and he was not involved in the sisters' cases.

Annette and Mylette were both students at Louis Sheffield Elementary in 1974. Their cases remain unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lillian-annette-anderson,-81.5981447,30.4560217

A witness reported seeing her being forced into a dark blue Chevrolet van by two men. One of the abductors was about twenty-two years old and the other was about thirty. The van had orange curtains and the word ""Aries"" on the side.

Her husband, Gary Benner, said she left in the middle of the night and never returned. She has never been heard from again. Her three-year-old daughter allegedly told a relative that ""Mommy had to go away because she was bleeding from the stomach.""

Gary always insisted his wife left him of her own accord, but he is the prime suspect in Joanne's disappearance. Authorities stated he behaved suspiciously after she went missing, and the couple argued constantly in their marriage.

When investigators searched the Benner residence, they saw what appeared to be blood in several places of the house. Gary told police the stains were nail polish and that Joanne had flung menstrual blood at him during an argument. Some carpeting was missing from the bedroom and was later found burned in a trash can. After Joanne's disappearance, Gary asked friends to mail letters and toys to his children pretending to be Joanne.

Investigators obtained blood evidence from the Benner home, as well as the burned carpet and some of Gary's guns. DNA testing was not available in 1976, so they were unable to match the blood to Joanne at that time. In 2008, authorities tried to have some of the evidence analyzed, but it was too old and degraded. The investigation has been stalled since then.

Gary has never been charged in connection with Joanne's case, but police stated they believed he murdered Joanne and buried her body somewhere in the area. He now lives in Tennessee.

",100 lbs - 110 lbs,"Aramburo was last seen on June 2, 2007 in Miami, Florida. Her boyfriend, Christen Pacheco, stated they had an argument and she walked out of their apartment in the 7600 block of southwest 82nd Street at 2:00 a.m., wearing only her nightgown and no shoes, carrying two bungee cords, and leaving behind her purse and cellular phone.

She has never been heard from again. Pacheco reported her missing 24 hours later. He says before he went to the police, he searched the neighborhood for hours looking for her. Aramburo had no car at the time of her disappearance and usually used public transportation to get around.

Aramburo's loved ones stated it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning and they did not believe she would have abandoned her young son. She was in danger of losing her parental rights due to drug abuse. Although she had entered a drug treatment program in order to keep her son, her urine had tested positive for drugs a few days before her disappearance and the family court judge warned her she would lose her son if she did not complete the treatment program.

(In spite of the positive drug test, Aramburo went under oath and denied any substance use. It's possible someone introduced them to her system without her knowledge.)

Although they were considering marriage, Aramburo's relationship with Pacheco was troubled and she reportedly told her mother she was afraid of him. Both of them abused drugs frequently. The police were called to their residence twice in response to Aramburo and Pacheco's arguments, but no arrests were ever made. Since Aramburo's disappearance, Pacheco has been arrested several times on drug charges.

Aramburo was born in San Francisco, California and moved to Miami as a baby. Her parents divorced when she was very young and she's had no contact with her father since then. As a child, she starred for several seasons on the Sabado Gigante Show, a Spanish-language weekly variety show that's broadcast to millions of viewers throughout the Americas.

According to her mother, Aramburo began using drugs in her freshman year of high school and was addicted to heroin within a few years. She dropped out of Hollywood Hills High School at age sixteen, but obtained her GED several years later.

Since Aramburo's disappearance there have been reported sightings of her in the Miami area, but none of these accounts have been confirmed. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lucely-aramburo,-80.1916391,25.7614406

Melissa Alaniz,"March 7, 1987","El Paso, Texas",12,Hispanic/Latino,"5'2""",105 lbs,"Melissa was last seen in El Paso, Texas on March 7, 1987. She went out to play video games at a convenience store off Rushing and never returned to her residence in the northeast part of the city. She has never been heard from again.

Two weeks earlier, Melissa had run away from home after a family argument. She returned after two days, however, and authorities don't believe she left of her own accord again when she went missing in March 1987.

That same year, several other females disappeared from El Paso, and most of them were later found murdered and buried in the desert. The victims were all small, slender young women in their teens and early twenties.

Melissa knew at least one of them, a classmate with whom she had friends in common. She lived in the same neighborhood as several of the victims and her parents worked with the parents of another victim. Melissa and two other girls, Marjorie Knox and Cheryl Vasquez, are still missing.

David Leonard Wood, a serial rapist who was paroled in January 1987, was later convicted of murdering six of the El Paso victims, though he maintains his innocence to this day. He was sentenced to death in 1993, but his sentence remains under appeal, as his lawyers allege he is mentally retarded.

The murders of El Paso girls and women stopped after Wood's October 1987 arrest for rape. He has not been charged in connection with Melissa's case and it's unclear whether he was involved. A photo of Wood is posted with this case summary. Melissa's disappearance remains unsolved.

",105 lbs - 125 lbs,"Allen was last seen at her home in El Paso, Texas on January 20, 1980. She lived in a second-floor apartment at Fountain Plaza on the west side of the city; she was an assistant manager there and also managed three other apartment complexes.

Between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m., she spoke to her sister on the phone. She may have also had breakfast that day with an unidentified man who had been her date to an awards dinner a few nights before. She has never been heard from again. She left no note behind at home, and hadn't told her loved ones of any travel plans.

On January 24, Allen's white 1971 Ford Thunderbird with suicide doors and the Texas license plate number MNL-431 was found near San Bernardino, California. Photographs of a similar vehicle are posted with this case summary.

Some receipts were inside the vehicle, all of them for charges made to Allen's husband's credit card. He had died two years before. Whoever made the charges forged Allen's husband's signature. The receipts were for gas stations in New Mexico and northern Arizona.

Allen was born in Cleburne, Texas and had four sons. Three of her sons have died in the years following her disappearance; the surviving one lives in California.

Barbara Ann Bockwith,"December 5, 1979","Escambia County, Florida",20,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",115 lbs,"Bockwith was last seen in Escambia County, Florida on December 5, 1979. She got up early that morning and breakfasted with a friend at a McDonald's restaurant on Navy Boulevard. Her behavior at the time was normal. After the mean Bockwith returned to her home in the 200 block of Greve Road in Pensacola, Florida and went back to bed. She left home again at 9:30 a.m. to go to class at the University of West Florida.

Two friends saw Bockwith on campus in Building 58 at 11:10 a.m., just ten minutes before she had an accounting class scheduled there, but uncharacteristically, she never showed up for the class. A longtime friend saw her driving through the intersection at Creighton Road and Ninth Avenue, heading south, at 12:05 p.m. She has never been heard from again.

On December 12, Bockwith's bright red 1977 Toyota hatchback with the Florida license plate number 9D-23821 was found in the long-term parking lot at the Pensacola Regional Airport.

The driver's seat was pushed back all the way, indicating that the last person to drive the car was taller than Bockwith. Her textbooks were in the backseat instead of in the passenger seat where she normally kept them, which suggests there were two people in the vehicle. Bockwith's purse was missing. She never touched her checking account, she contained $1,500.

Bockwith had told several friends about having problems with her sometime boyfriend, Robert McClellan ""Mack"" Deaver, prior to her disappearance. They had dated steadily two years earlier, but their relationship was troubled.

Bockwith's family and friends described Deaver as an extremely jealous man with a volatile temper. Twice Bockwith filed complaints with the police against him. In April 1978, he was accused of an ""unprovoked"" attack against Bockwith's new boyfriend while Bockwith was with him. Deaver pleaded guilty to charge and completed a term of probation.

The second complaint, filed in the summer of 1978, alleged that Deaver had kicked Bockwith's Toyota repeatedly, causing minor damage, and when she asked him to pay for the repairs, he rammed his car into hers, struck her and tore a necklace off her throat. Charges were filed against Deaver in connection with the incident, but they were later dropped. Shortly afterwards, he went to Louisiana, and didn't return until shortly before Bockwith's disappearance.

Deaver and Bockwith began dating again after he moved back to Florida, something her parents didn't learn about until after she disappeared. He was still jealous and told Bockwith he would ""slap her down"" if he caught her with another man. Although her friends suggested he might have been involved in her disappearance, after she went missing he seemed very upset and helped Bockwith's family with the search.

Deaver was scheduled to take a lie detector test about Bockwith's disappearance with a private investigator on December 11, the day after her car was found. After he missed the appointment, Bockwith's brother went to his house and found him dead in the garage. He had shot himself to death. Deaver left a note for his mother which said nothing about Bockwith or her disappearance. It isn't clear whether he is considered a suspect in Bockwith's case.

It's completely uncharacteristic of Bockwith to leave without warning; her parents, whom she lived with, stated she always kept them informed of her plans. She was an honors student at the university, where she majored in accounting, and she had also worked for her parents' real estate company. At eighteen years old, she had been the youngest real estate agent in Florida history. She graduated from Escambia High School at age seventeen, enrolled at Pensacola Junior College, and transferred to the University of West Florida by the age of nineteen.

Investigators believe Bockwith is deceased. Her case remains unsolved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/barbara-ann-bockwith

She has never been heard from again. She left her clothes, jewelry, keys, checkbook and $750 in cash at her home, as well as her car parked in the driveway.

Her family stated it would be uncharacteristic of her to abandon her children. She lived in the 1300 block of southwest 14th Street at the time of her disappearance. One of her children was at college, one had moved out of the family home and married, and the two youngest ones were still at home.

Carol had been separated from her husband of 21 years, Giacomo ""Jack"" Arcuri, for about a year and a half. They were in the process of a divorce, and Jack was living with a girlfriend, but Carol still worked for him at A&B Auto Parts in Delray Beach, Florida. The business was co-owned by Jack and Carol's brother.

Carol allegedly told friends and her daughter that Jack had bound her hands, threatened her with a gun and tried to strangle her several days before her disappearance, and her daughter noticed red marks around her neck and wrists. Carol visited a doctor on November 17 with yellowing of the eyes, bleeding from the nose, headaches and a cough, and was diagnosed with an iron deficiency. However, these symptoms could also be caused by attempted strangulation.

Jack denied the allegations and said he had never attacked his wife and had nothing to do with her disappearance. He claimed he'd seen Carol on the day she went missing and she went out with another man, who used to work at the auto parts store. He refused to cooperate with the investigation into his wife's disappearance and hired an attorney, who told investigators not to approach him.

In 1982, Jack was charged with running an auto theft ring out of his store. (Carol's brother wasn't a suspect in the thefts.) After bonding out of jail, he disappeared. He later turned up in Tucson, Arizona; he had died by suicide.

Although Jack and Carol's daughters had accused him of murdering their mother, and Carol's disappearance is being investigated as a homicide, he was never charged in connection with her disappearance.

Ofir Ben-Haim,"March 25, 2010","Fair Lawn, New Jersey",6 months,CaucasianÊ / White,"2'0""",25 lbs,"Ofir's parents, Oshrat and Sharon Ben-Haim, are both from Israel. They moved to the United States in 2004 and began living together in 2006. They married in Israel in 2008, then returned to the United States to live in an apartment in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Ofir was born there, making her an American citizen. Oshrat was attending Manhattan Community College on a student visa, while Sharon worked and was the sole provider for the family. The Ben-Haims' marriage ran into problems because Sharon was more religious than his wife.

On March 25, 2010, the entire family traveled to Israel to celebrate an extended passover holiday with family members. Oshrat and Sharon didn't spend much time together; Sharon stayed at his mother's house, and Oshrat and Ofir stayed at Oshrat's parents' house. Oshrat initiated divorce proceedings against her husband in a rabbinical court, and sought to keep him and Ofir from leaving Israel.

Sharon and Oshrat began negotiating a divorce settlement, but neither of them had signed a binding contract before Sharon's scheduled return to the United States on April 20. He stated he expected Oshrat and Ofir to come back to the U.S. on June 20, something they'd agreed before their visit to Israel. Although they had plane tickets purchased in advance, Oshrat and Ofir never made their flight.

A felony warrant for kidnapping was issued for Oshrat on December 21, 2011. In August 2010, two and a half years after she took Ofir to Israel, New Jersey authorities indicted her on six counts of custodial inference and two counts of violation of a court order.

Photos of Oshrat is posted with this case summary. Her date of birth is November 5, 1981, making her 28 years old at the time of Ofir's abduction. She's described as Caucasian, 5'1 and 95 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes.

A New Jersey court ordered Oshrat to return Ofir to the United States immediately, but she ignored the order and they can't enforce it, since Israel is outside their jurisdiction. Sharon attempted to have Ofir returned to his care through the Israeli courts, but they demanded he present himself in person at the hearings. He left his job and his life in America, traveled to Israel and stayed there for four months to work with the courts system.

An Israeli judge ordered that Oshrat to go back to the United States with Ofir, and also ordered Sharon to rent an apartment for his wife and deposit $6,000 for her use. Oshrat appealed the order, and an appeals court upheld the ruling but changed the deposit sum from $6,000 to $10,000. Oshrat took her appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously that she'd unlawfully abducted her daughter.

However, the court also ruled that Ofir should stay in Israel and her father should go there to pursue the custody case. An American judge examined the Israeli Supreme Court ruling and determined they'd acted against the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a treaty both Israel and the United States signed.

Sharon has had only sporadic contact with his child since 2010, and he hasn't seen her at all before her first birthday. Oshrat has refused to return her to the United States in spite of numerous court rulings against her in both the United States and Israel. The child's case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/22969

During the early morning hours she chatted on the internet with a friend from Texas about Amanda's plans to take her children and move to Arizona, the place of her birth, to live with her father. She was upbeat at the time and looking forward to the move. Amanda spoke to a Canadian friend on the phone before going to bed at 6:30 a.m. She has never been heard from again.

Amanda's husband, Matthew Carroll, a Marine Corps captain, was named as a suspect in her case several months after her disappearance. He and the couple's two young daughters were visiting his parents in New York on the day she was last heard from.

Amanda married Matthew when she was 16 years old. The relationship was reportedly happy until the family moved to New Jersey six months prior to her disappearance, at which point Amanda became depressed and decided to leave her husband and seek a divorce.

The police were called to their residence two days before her disappearance due to a domestic dispute, but no violence had occurred and no charges were filed.

Matthew has never been charged in Amanda's case and has stated he believes she left of her own accord, possibly with someone she met on the internet. Authorities have investigated all of her known internet acquaintances, however, and cleared them of involvement in her case. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/606

Angela Darcel Cephas,"April 4, 1984","Port Norris, New Jersey",20,African American / Black,"4'3"" - 4'5""
",135 lbs,"Cephas was last seen in Port Norris, New Jersey at 12:00 p.m. on May 4, 1984. She lived with her family on Dragston Road near North Avenue, and was last seen riding her bicycle away from the residence. The bike is described as a pink and white 20-inch Huffy girls' model with a white banana seat, the image of flowers on the frame, and the initials ""KC"" on the neck near the handlebars.

Cephas has never been heard from again. She left her purse, cigarettes and watch behind at home, and her bike has never been recovered.

When Cephas left home, she told her sister she was going to visit her former boyfriend, an older man who lived nearby. Cephas's sisters stated this man was the father of her unborn baby and that he didn't want to take responsibility for the child; they believe he was involved in Cephas's disappearance.

The man refused to cooperate with the police investigation after Cephas vanished. When he was interviewed by The Atlantic City Press in 1998, he said he had never dated her and was not the father of her baby, but only knew her as a neighbor.

Prior to her disappearance, Cephas had said she was thinking of running away from home, but her family doesn't believe she would have left without saying where she was going. She had never lived outside her neighborhood prior to her disappearance. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/34471

Lola I. Carney,"September 12, 1982","Clarksboro, New Jersey",40,CaucasianÊ / White,"5'4""",135 lbs,"Lola was last seen at her home in the 200 block of Whiskey Mill Road in Clarksboro, New Jersey, at 11:00 p.m. on September 12, 1982. Her husband, George Carney, told her two children that she left home in the middle of the night, taking $17,000 and a handgun, and would not return. George was her fourth husband, and the father of her youngest child.

Lola left home driving a red 1973 Chevrolet Nova hatchback with the New Jersey license plate number 752RZD and a vehicle identification number (VIN) 1X17D3W289214. Neither she nor the vehicle have ever been seen again. The car did not belong to her; it was her sister's. Lola left her own car, an almost-new Lincoln, behind.

George refused to report Lola missing; her sister finally did on January 3, 1983. Lola and George often argued and before her disappearance, Lola told her sister she was contemplating moving out of George's home and filing for divorce.

She was very close to her children, however, and it would be uncharacteristic of her to leave them voluntarily for so long. She had three children, two of whom were living with her when she vanished. She vanished the night before they were due to start the new school year.

George said Lola was having an affair with someone in September 1982. Lola had left her husband numerous times before, but she always took the children with her, and she always returned after a short time.

She left her dentures behind when she went missing. George says she had a new set made before she disappeared, but this has not been confirmed. Lola has not renewed her driver's license or used her Social Security number since her disappearance.

George later divorced Lola on grounds of desertion. She was declared legally dead in 1990. Investigators bored through some concrete near Lola's house in 2004, but they found no evidence related to her disappearance. Police believe she is missing under suspicious circumstances and was probably murdered.","http://charleyproject.org/case/lola-i-carney

Jan Andre Cotta,"June 26, 1973","Wall Township, New Jersey",19,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",125 lbs,"Cotta was last seen inside a barn tack house on her family's property in the Allenwood section of Wall Township, New Jersey on June 26, 1973.

Her brother and a friend saw her sometime between 11:30 p.m. and midnight. A vehicle was heard driving away from the farm and afterwards, Cotta was discovered to be missing. She has never been heard from again.

Cotta has seven siblings and is described as an avid equestrian who won awards in riding competitions. She was active in the 4-H Club and also attended riding classes at the Morven Park International Equestrian Institute in Leesburg, Virginia and the Princeton Riding Academy. She wasn't involved with drugs and didn't drink alcohol at the time of her disappearance

The identity of her unborn baby's father is unknown. Cotta wrote a letter to God before she went missing and referred to the baby's father, but she didn't say what his name was. In the letter, she stated she was giving three of her favorite horses to a friend. Authorities believe she left of her own accord, at least initially.

In August 1973, a newborn baby was found abandoned in a mailbox on a horse farm in Jefferson Township, New Jersey. The farm belonged to the friend Cotta gave her horses to, and the baby was born around the same time Cotta's baby was due. Due to these circumstances there was speculation that the child was hers, but DNA tests disproved this theory.

Cotta's parents both died in the years following her disappearance, but her siblings are still searching for her. Her case remains unsolved.

Rosemary K. Calandriello,"August 25 ,1969","Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey",17,Caucasian / White,"5'5"" - 5'7""
",120 lbs,"Rosemary was last seen at her family's home in the 90 block of Center Avenue in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey at 6:00 p.m. on August 25, 1969. Her mother gave her two dollars and sent her out to buy milk and ice pops for the family's dinner.

The store was only two blocks away, and Rosemary was expected to return home within a few minutes, but she never arrived. She has never been heard from again. Her mother reported her disappearance to the police two hours after she was last seen.

Rosemary is the youngest of four children and the only child still living with her parents by the time of her disappearance. She had only recently started dating, had no steady boyfriend, and was generally kept very sheltered by her family. She was not allowed out at night without being accompanied by her parents, and she was afraid of the dark.

At the time of her disappearance, her father was in poor health and had taken leave from his job as a result. Rosemary assumed many household responsibilities, including shopping for groceries and paying bills, due to her father's illness. Her parents never believed she ran away from home, as this was extremely uncharacteristic of her behavior.

When authorities canvassed the area, they found four of Rosemary's high school classmates who claimed to have seen her riding in a car with a stranger, an older male. The vehicle was described as a beat-up black and white Ford Galaxy convertible. The boys followed the car in their own vehicle for a few blocks, because they were curious about seeing Rosemary with an older man.

The police made a composite drawing of the unidentified man based off the boys' descriptions. After this sighting was reported in the newspapers, a woman told investigators that a man who closely resembled the sketch and drove a similar car had offered a ride to her twelve-year-old daughter and her daughter's friend. He made the offer on three separate occasions and also offered to give the girls some wine. The girls had memorized the vehicle's license plate and police determined it belonged to Robert Zarinsky. Photographs of him are posted with this case summary.

Zarinsky had a history of antisocial and criminal behavior dating back to his childhood, and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. After linking him to Rosemary's disappearance, authorities arrested him for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. This charge was connected to his allegedly offering alcohol to the two underage girls, but police believed he had also harmed Rosemary.

He was seen washing the trunk of his Ford Galaxy after Rosemary went missing, something he rarely did. When authorities inspected the car, the window and door handles on the passenger side were absent. One of Rosemary's hair clips was found on the floor of the vehicle, and in the backseat was a pair of blue women's panties. Rosemary's mother identified the panties as her daughter's, but Zarinsky's wife stated they were her own. A ball-peen hammer with a bloodstained hair stuck to the end was also located.

After his arrest, Rosemary's four high school classmates identified Zarinsky as the man they had seen with her on the evening of her disappearance. While he was in jail, he allegedly confessed Rosemary's murder to a cellmate, and said no one would ever find her body.

Zarinsky was convicted on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and he was released. The FBI analyzed the bloody hair found in his car and linked it to another teenager, Linda Balabanow, whose body was found in the Raritan River in Port Reading, New Jersey four months before Rosemary disappeared. She had been strangled with an electrical cord.

Authorities suspected Zarinsky had killed her and also murdered Joanne Delardo and Donna Carlucci, two teenage girls from Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, who were both also strangled with an electrical cord. There was not enough evidence to prosecute in any of the cases, however.

In 1974, Zarinsky was charged with Rosemary's murder on the basis of circumstantial evidence. He was convicted in 1975 and sentenced to ninety-eight years in prison. He was the first person in the state of New Jersey to be convicted of murder in a case where the victim's body had not been found. In 1999, he was additionally charged with murder in the 1958 shooting death of Charles Bernoskie, a police officer. He was acquitted, but Bernoskie's widow won a $9.5 million civil judgement against him in 2003.

At one of his parole hearings, Zarinsky stated he had killed Rosemary accidentally. He said he had driven her to a local lover's lane and she had gotten drunk and left his vehicle to relieve herself, and he accidentally backed over her and killed her. Prior to making this statement, for years he had denied having even ever met Rosemary.

In April 2008, he was charged with murder in the 1968 death of a thirteen-year-old girl, Jane Durrua. She had been raped, beaten and strangled. He was awaiting trial for the murder when he died of pulmonary fibrosis in December 2008.

Authorities believe Zarinsky was a serial killer; he is a suspect in several murders besides the ones he was charged with, and his own sister attributed as many as ten homicides to him.

Rosemary's remains have never been located, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/rosemary-k-calandriello,-74.0426468,40.415604

Myrisha Faye Campbell,"September 6, 1958","Goliad, Texas",3,Caucasian / White,"2'6""",28 lbs,"Myrisha and her brother A.J. were last seen in Goliad, Texas on September 6, 1958. They lived with their mother, Jewel Bernay Campbell. The children's father, A.J. Campbell Sr., took them for a ride and never returned them.

Photographs of both the children's parents are posted with this case summary. They had been married for eight years and A.J. was very abusive towards Jewel. She took the children and left him, supporting herself with a teaching job in Goliad, Texas. A.J. Sr. had court-ordered visitation times with them on Saturdays, and it was during one of those visits that they disappeared. He took them at 9:00 a.m. and was supposed to bring them back by 3:00 p.m.

William Randle Jr., an acquaintance of A.J. Sr., was the last person to see the children besides their father. Randle stated he and A.J. Sr. picked up the children in Goliad, then drove away in Randle's two-door pink and charcoal-gray 1955 Chevrolet Tudor with the Texas license plate number MA-9996. They went through Cuero, Texas and Gonzales, Texas, stopping along the way to pick up two large cans of lard.

When they were about three miles outside Goliad, A.J. Sr. asked Randle to stop because he wanted to see a friend. Randle stopped and got out of the car, and A.J. drove on without him, with both children inside the vehicle.

About thirty to forty minutes later, A.J. returned to pick Randle up. The children were no longer with him. He said he'd gone to visit his brother-in-law, but they had a fight, and he wound up leaving the children with another relative. A.J. seemed nervous and agitated at the time, asked if he had any blood on him and warned Randle to tell no one about the fight.

They drove to San Antonio, Texas and then separated. A.J. was supposed to meet Randle at a bus station at midnight the next day to return the car, but he never showed up. Randle took a bus to Fort Worth, Texas and then reported his car as stolen.

The following day, A.J. Sr. spoke to a Fort Worth, Texas minister on the telephone that day and implied that he had killed his children, saying they were ""at rest with the world"" and that he was going to kill himself. Early on September 7, A.J. Sr.'s body was later found inside Randle's vehicle on a rural road near Austin, Texas. His death was ruled a suicide; he had shot himself in the head with a new 16-gauge shotgun.

He left a note addressed to Jewel. The note said he had ""buried both children"" and that he loved the children and he loved Jewel and hoped she would be happy. There was no indication of the children's whereabouts, and no trace of them could be found.

Jewel remarried after A.J.'s death and took the name Robertson, and had two more children. She died in 2013. Her children by her second marriage, Regina Meynig and Phil Robertson, have been active in the search for A.J. Jr. and Myrisha and hope that they may be located. They believe there's a chance that the children are alive and A.J. Sr. gave or sold them to someone instead of killing them.

They had packed food and clothes into Berry's vehicle and also had an Irish Setter puppy that belonged to her.

Berry disappeared at around midnight and was last seen sitting around a campfire about a quarter-mile from the headquarters of the cooking contest. She may have left the area riding on the back of a Honda 350 motorcycle with an unidentified male, described as being in his twenties with blond hair.

Berry has never been seen again. Because she was happy with her life and because she left all her belongings behind, her roommate doesn't believe she left of her own accord. Foul play is suspected in her case.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/2927

In 1995, Paul Gayland Taylor Jr. pleaded guilty to Beard's murder and led authorities to a rice field in Brazoria County, south of Angleton, Texas. He said he had buried her body in a shallow grave there, but a search of the field turned up no evidence.

Taylor was a suspect in Beard's case from the beginning, but authorities lacked enough evidence to file charges until 1994. He was incarcerated at the time on charges of driving while intoxicated, and one of his cellmates told investigators he had bragged about killing Beard. He said he shot her to death at his home in Clute, Texas.

Taylor was sentenced to life in prison for Beard's murder. He was also sentenced to 25 years in prison for solicitation to commit capital murder; he tried to hire someone to kill a witness in Beard's case.

Rachel Louise Cooke,"Georgetown, Texas","January 10, 2002",19,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",110 lbs - 120 lbs,"Cooke was visiting her parents' home in the Northlake subdivision of Georgetown, Texas in early 2002. She was on winter vacation from her school at San Diego Mesa College in San Diego, California. She was last seen by her family at 8:00 a.m. January 10, 2002, when her mother left for work. She was still asleep at this time, on the couch.

Cooke departed from her family's residence for her daily four-mile run during the morning hours that day, sometime after her mother left. She is believed to have started her run at approximately 9:30 a.m. She was last seen between 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. near Neches Trail, which is just 100 to 200 yards from her family's residence.

Cooke never returned to their residence and has not been heard from again. She was missed at 3:00 p.m. that day when her father came home to take her shopping and could not find her.

Witnesses told authorities that an unidentified male was driving a late-model white or blue Chevrolet Camaro or Pontiac Trans Am with white or black stripes along the hood and the trunk in the area of Cooke's disappearance. He was reportedly speaking to another female jogger at the time. The man is described as being in his late teens to early twenties with slicked-back black hair. He had a dark complexion and may have been Hispanic.

Some witnesses reported seeing a man inside the vehicle, which traveled along Navajo Trail and turned southbound on to Neches Trail. Sketches of the unidentified male are posted with this case summary. Some witnesses claim to have seen two men inside the car.

Authorities are also searching for information concerning a white pickup truck that was seen in the Northlake subdivision on January 10. The vehicle may have had a wide dark-colored stripe across its lower portion. Witnesses stated that the sports car and the truck stopped along the road to speak to the jogger shortly after Cooke's disappearance. A sketch of an unidentified male reportedly seen near the female jogger is posted with this case summary.

Investigators announced that one of the possible unidentified witnesses contacted authorities voluntarily one week after Cooke vanished. The individual was cleared of any involvement in her case.

In August 2006, Michael Keith Moore confessed to Cooke's murder. A photograph of Moore is posted below this case summary. He stated he attacked Cooke while jogging, knocked her unconscious, drove her somewhere and raped her. After murdering her, he wrapped her body in a tarp, weighted it with rocks and threw it into Matagorda Bay.

Moore has an extensive criminal history and has spent nearly all of his adult life in prison. His father stated he began to get into trouble with the law at the age of 13, and many of his known offenses involve sexual misconduct and/or violence. At the time of his confession in Cooke's case, he was already in police custody after being convicted of murdering a pregnant woman.

He agreed to plead guilty to Cooke's murder in November 2006 in exchange for a sentence of life in prison, but in court Moore reneged and pleaded not guilty in Cooke's case.

Moore told the media he had been toying with authorities when he confessed to killing Cooke, and that he got special treatment in prison in exchange for his cooperation. He stated he had nothing to do with her disappearance and the police should have known that.

Prosecutors announced that he will go to trial for Cooke's murder. Her remains have not been found, but investigators believe Moore's confession was accurate.

Cooke was an accomplished cross-country runner at the time of her disappearance. All of her personal belongings were left behind at her family's home, where her parents and younger sister then resided. (Her father died of natural causes in November 2014, at age 59.)

At the time of her disappearance, Cooke was a student at Mesa Junior College in California and was planning to transfer to a college in Los Angeles, California to study fashion design. She has no history of leaving her family home without warning; she always left a note saying where she would be going.

Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/924

It was a slow night and the management decided to send two servers home early. Breckenridge volunteered to go, which is uncharacteristic of her behavior. A security guard escorted her to her car and she drove away without incident.

Breckenridge was returning to her apartment on Houston's northwest side at the time she disappeared. Her red 1986 Pontiac Fiero was discovered abandoned and locked in the 1200 block of West Loop North near 12th Street, along her normal route home, at 2:30 a.m. The car alarm and the flashers were off, and a can of mace Breckenridge carried for protection was inside. There was no indication of a struggle, but the vehicle's alternator belt was missing. She has never been seen again.

Breckenridge's live-in boyfriend is considered a possible suspect in her case. Their relationship was troubled and Breckenridge often spoke of leaving him. The boyfriend says he was at a pool hall at the time Breckenridge disappeared, and he didn't realize she was missing until he came home at 5:00 a.m. and she wasn't there.

Her car was located only about three miles from the pool hall, and witnesses at the establishment said the boyfriend left at 1:45 a.m. and was gone for approximately an hour and forty-five minutes before returning to the pool hall. He maintains her innocence in her disappearance.

Foul play is suspected in Breckenridge's case. There were several abductions of young women in the Houston area in the early 1990's.

Madeline Ponds,"November 20, 1986","Columbus, MS",,,,,"Madeline was last seen working alone at her job at PJ's One-Stop, a convenience store on southbound Highway 82 in Columbus, Mississippi on November 20, 1986.

Her mother brought her some dinner, then returned to their residence. Less than five minutes later, a customer discovered that the store was unattended and contacted authorities.

Approximately $600 was missing from the cash register. Madeline's personal belongings were still inside the business and her car was parked in the store's lot with her purse, wallet, keys and hairbrush. She has never been heard from again.

Madeline's mother says it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without taking her hairbrush or telling someone where she was going. She believes Madeline was abducted and says her daughter would not have gone without a fight.

She was partying there with friends. She has never been heard from again. She left her shoes and coat inside the nightclub.

Temperatures outside were below freezing and authorities believe Booth would not have left the building willingly without her coat or shoes, unless she was only planning to be gone a short time.

One of Booth's male friends, Ron Ferrengburg, dropped her off at the club and left, driving Booth's maroon and white 1975 or 1977 AMC Pacer. Booth was discovered missing at 11:00 p.m., when Ferrengburg returned to pick her up and couldn't find her. She was not reported missing for five days, however.

She was accompanied by Mario Alberto Prieto, who was also known as Dr. Luis Prieto, Spartacus Roberts and Mario Lopez, at the time. A photo of Prieto is posted with this case summary. Beltran has never been heard from again. She did not know Prieto and had met him for the first time the night of her disappearance.

Authorities believe that Beltran accompanied Prieto to his residence at Bear Creek Apartments in the 2000 block of State Highway 360 in Euless, Texas during the early morning hours of September 9. Investigators believe that Prieto may have assaulted Beltran afterwards. Evidence of a violent confrontation, including bloodstains which someone had tried to clean up, was discovered inside of his apartment, and almost all of Pietro's personal belongings were gone.

Neighbors reported hearing a woman screaming at 2:00 a.m. the day of Beltran's disappearance. One neighbor also claims to have seen Pietro removing a rancid-smelling box from his apartment on September 10. Pietro allegedly declined the neighbor's offer of assistance with the box, which appeared to be heavy.

Investigators learned that Prieto was driving a stolen 2000 Ford Expedition and staying in a San Antonio, Texas motel on September 11, 2000. Officers pursued Prieto, who rammed his vehicle into several other cars before stopping alongside the highway. Prieto got out the vehicle while holding a gun to his head. Police shot him to death after he pointed the gun at them; his weapon turned out to be a BB gun. He had a criminal record for theft, but no known history of violent offenses.

Authorities were unable to locate any evidence as to Beltran's whereabouts after Pietro's death, but DNA testing determined that the blood found in Pietro's apartment was hers. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance.

Beltran was employed as an au pair, or live-in nanny, in Southlake, Texas in 2000. She had resided with her host family since February of that year and had moved with them from Virginia to Texas. She planned to improve her English before moving back to Peru to start a teaching career.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/10825?language=en&legacyRedirect=true

Kathryn Elizabeth Collins,"April 1, 1981","Port Lavaca, Texas",23,Caucasian / White,"5'5"" - 5'8""
",125 lbs - 135 lbs,"Collins was last seen in Port Lavaca, Texas at 8:45 a.m. on April 1, 1981. She left her three-year-old son with her boyfriend's parents and went to Port Lavaca to go grocery shopping and see a doctor. Her car developed a flat tire and she pulled over in front of the former Shell Fish Restaurant, just off the causeway.

A light-colored van was seen nearby, and Collins was last seen with the van's driver, apparently getting ready to change her tire. She has never been heard from again and her car was later found abandoned, its tire still flat.

There is some speculation that Collins's disappearance is connected to the disappearance of Wanda ""Wendy"" Priddy, who went missing from Port Lavaca in 1978 and was never found. Police questioned a man who knew both women, but there was no evidence to link him to either case, and he died in 1991.

Collins moved from Blessing to Lolita, Texas about a month prior to her disappearance. She was carrying a substantial amount of cash on her the day she went missing. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/8815

Maria Guadalupe Barrientos,"June 6, 1994","Sugarland, Texas",43,Hispanic / Latina,"5'3""",130 lbs,"Barrientos was last seen in Sugarland, Texas on June 6, 1994. She worked as a nanny and was last seen at 5:00 p.m., when she left her job to go home. She has never been heard from again. The next day, when Barrientos didn't show up for work, her employer called her house to ask where she was. Her boss spoke to her son-in-law, Frank Jose Trejos, who said Barrientos had left because she was angry with him about his not mowing the lawn.

Frank and his wife, Brenda Vanessa Trejos, Barrientos's daughter, lived with Barrientos in 1994, and Brenda was seven months pregnant when her mother disappeared. A photo of Brenda is posted below this case summary. She and her husband reported Barrientos as a missing person on June 11, five days after she was last seen.

Other than filing the police report, they made no effort to find her, although some of Barrientos's friends posted fliers in the neighborhood. She left all her money behind and her bank account untouched, and she left behind her bicycle, which she used frequently, and her Bible, which she carried everywhere.

On June 29, the police searched Barrientos's home for evidence in her case. Frank and Brenda lived with her. Investigators found possible bloodstains on a towel in the residence and four adult-sized bloody footprints in the hallway. The towel was sent in for analysis and testing determined the stains on it were not blood.

Barrientos's vehicle was discovered in Houston, Texas on June 30, the day after the house search and 24 days after she vanished. It was unlocked and the keys were in the ignition. There was no sign of her at the scene, but her purse, wallet and keys were discovered inside the car and there was blood on the back floor mats.

When interviewed about his mother-in-law's disappearance, Frank told police he had last seen her asleep at home between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m. on June 6. He and his wife had left the house at that point and when they returned, the front door was ajar and Barrientos and her car were gone.

He said Barrientos had recently mopped the kitchen floor, but the kitchen floor was being re-tiled at the time of her disappearance and was only bare concrete. Every place he said she had mopped later tested positive for blood. Brenda and Jose were suspects in Barrientos's disappearance for years, but investigators lacked the evidence to charge either of them in her case.

In 2001, after being interviewed again about Barrientos, Frank confessed to her murder. He stated he beat and choked her to death during an argument. He and Brenda put her body in the bathtub and cut her wrists to make her death look like a suicide, but the cuts didn't bleed, so they decided to get rid of her body.

Brenda later confessed not only to helping dispose of her body but to actively assisting her husband in Barrientos's murder. They decided to kill her, she said, after Barrientos asked them to move out of her home because they were both unemployed and weren't helping with either the household chores or the bills.

Brenda and Jose said they'd buried Barrientos in a field near Fulshear, Texas, in north Fort Bend County. Frank led authorities to the burial site but they could not find her remains, as there had been fires in the area, trees had been removed, the ground had been plowed over and leveled with eighteen inches of soil added. Cadaver-sniffing dogs, however, did indicate the presence of human remains in the field; it's possible for them to smell a decomposing body even if it is no longer there.

Prosecutors, even with the confessions, had to spend a year gathering enough evidence to prove Barrientos was in fact dead. Brenda and Jose were charged in January 2003 and were tried separately. At her trial, Brenda claimed she assisted her husband in covering up Barrientos's murder, but did not contribute to her mother's death herself. She was convicted of murder and sentenced to 80 years in prison in February 2005. Frank was convicted in May 2005 and sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Although her remains have never been found, foul play is suspected in Barrientos's case due to the circumstances involved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/maria-guadalupe-barrientos

https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/6096
On July 14, 1985, after visiting her grandmother, Angelica headed to her home in Temple, TX, on foot. The walk was only two blocks away from her house and it was something she had done numerous times before. She never made it home. Angelica was allegedly seen in a 1977 Chevrolet pickup truck with an unidentified white male and female. The pickupÕs hood, front fender and bed were red and white in color, the doors were blue and white, and the top was white. The pickup was dented, dirty and unkept.
In 2007, over 22 years after Angelica disappeared, authorities named serial killer David E. Penton as a possible suspect in her case, as well as several other missing girls. He has been serving a prison sentence in Texas since 1987 and allegedly signed a plea deal admitting responsibility for three missing girls from TX. He didnÕt admit to the kidnapping of Angelica, however.

Christine Starrine Byrd,"May 27, 1992","Tyler, Texas",42,African American / Black,"5'1"" - 5'3""
",160 lbs,"Byrd was last seen in Tyler, Texas on May 27, 1992. She has never been heard from again. She left food cooking on the stove in her house when she vanished. There were no indications of forced entry.

Authorities believe Byrd's disappearance could be related to the murder of a local eight-year-old boy, Ernest Chadwick ""Chad"" Choice. Chad was kidnapped from his bedroom in November 1991. Two days later, a ransom note was found at his uncle's workplace.

The family tried to deliver the money at a bus station as per the instructions in the note, but no one showed up to collect it. Chad's family got an anonymous phone call saying he had been abducted to collect on a debt his uncle owed to three Colombian drug dealers.

On the one-year anniversary of his abduction, Chad's mother found another note left on her car windshield; the note said Chad was still alive and demanded $6,000 for his return. The alleged kidnapper(s) never made contact with his family again.

In 1995, on the fourth anniversary of the abduction, Chad's skull was left in a grocery bag on his uncle's front porch. Patrick Horn ultimately led authorities to the rest of the body and was convicted of the child's murder in 1997.

Horn, a friend of Chad's older brother, was only seventeen years old at the time of Chad's abduction and murder. He said the three Colombian drug dealers had abducted and shot Chad, and that he was not involved in the crime and only disposed of the body because he was in fear for his life.

At the time of his conviction in Chad's case, Horn was already serving life in prison without parole for carjacking and bank robbery. He was sentenced to death for Chad's murder, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment due to his age at the time of the crime. His statements about the alleged drug dealers have never been verified and no one else was ever charged in Chad's case.

Investigators stated Horn had been a suspect in Byrd's disappearance since shortly after she vanished. They believe she may have known something about Chad Choice's murder and was killed as a result. Christopher Wells, an associate of Horn's, may have helped move Byrd's remains, but he hasn't been charged in her case. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/9482

Barnes left behind a young daughter. Although it wasn't unusual for her to drop out of sight for a few days, she was never gone for very long. Before she went missing, she told her sister a man had threatened her with a knife. She was unable to remember the man's name, however, and it's unclear whether the incident was related to her later disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.

Rachael Leigh Anderson,"April 16, 2010","Moscow, Idaho",40,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",120 lbs,"Anderson was last seen in Moscow, Idaho on April 16, 2010. She has never been heard from again. She was last seen on a Friday, and Anderson's two daughters reported her missing on Monday after she didn't show up for her job at a pathology lab. On April 21, her borrowed car, a white 1997 GMC Yukon with the license plate number 1l 93131, was found at a Dynamart station in Lewiston, Idaho, near the Greyhound bus station. Her cellular phone and purse were inside the vehicle.

Prior to her disappearance, Anderson had filed multiple complaints with the police about being harassed and stalked by her an unknown individual. This person had broken her car's back windshield, had slashed her tires, watched her house and sent her disturbing text messages and telephone calls.

Anderson was afraid for her life. The incidents began about three months before her disappearance, and she believed her estranged husband, Charles A. Capone, might be responsible. She talked to the police about the stalking on the day of her disappearance and they advised her to avoid Capone because he might become violent.

Capone was arrested on a weapons charge in May 2010. He has a long criminal history dating back to 1985 and a history of violent behavior towards women. As a convicted felon, he is prohibited from having guns. Anderson's daughter stated Capone was an abusive, controlling husband and that Anderson had filed filed harassment charges against him. In December 2009, Capone allegedly choked Anderson and was charged with second-degree assault.

The couple was married for only three months before Anderson filed for divorce in January 2010. After Capone's arrest, he was named as a person of interest in his wife's disappearance. He later pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm and served 33 months in prison.

Capone and a friend, David Stone, were charged with Anderson's murder in April 2013. Photographs of Stone and Capone posted with this case summary. Authorities believe Capone killed his wife, Stone helped him do it, and they disposed of the body together.

Cadaver dogs indicated the scent of human remains in the back of the GMC Yukon which Anderson had borrowed to drive while Capone repaired her own vehicle. Blood from both Anderson and Capone was found on the tip of a black latex glove in the Yukon.

In addition, in 2010, an individual came forward and said Capone had offered him $10,000 to kill Anderson. The person said Capone and Stone had a plan to kill both their wives; Stone's wife had a large insurance policy on her life. While in jail after his weapons arrest in May 2010, Capone allegedly told cellmates he had poisoned Anderson by putting prescription sleeping pills in her beer, and then buried the body.

In December 2013, Stone pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of failure to notify law enforcement about a death and agreed to testify against Capone at his upcoming murder trial. In exchange he will serve a seven-year sentence in prison. Capone was found guilty of first-degree murder in September 2014, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Anderson lived in the 2200 block of Main in Clarkston, Washington at the time of her disappearance, and some agencies stated she went missing from there. Clarkston police are investigating her case.

There had been problems in Boiteau's life prior to her disappearance. Her family said she had a normal childhood, but developed behavior problems in early adolescence and got involved with drugs. She got clean for a time after she became pregnant in 2014, but she began using drugs again and was jailed.

After the birth of her daughter, Boiteau was released on house arrest and went to live with her father.

She left her home in the 2300 block of River Road to travel four or five miles to Cushing, Wisconsin to meet a cousin at a bar. She was driving a white 2001 Pontiac Grand Am with a Wisconsin license plate numbered 535MAB. Sometime that night, Bly contacted her husband and said she'd be home by midnight. She never arrived in Cushing, however, and has never been heard from again.

Bly's car was found in a parking lot near a post office in Grantsburg, Wisconsin five days after her disappearance. The lot is normally used by semi truck drivers to park their tractor-trailers. The car was undamaged, there was no evidence of foul play and the keys were missing. Grantsburg is about thirty miles from St. Croix and fifteen miles from Cushing. Bly has family living there and she graduated from Grantsburg High School.

Bly left behind a husband and two daughters under the age of two. She doesn't have any credit or debit cards, and she left home with very little money. Bly's husband filed for divorce three weeks after her disappearance and sought a court order to prevent her from returning and taking the children. They had married in February 2009.

Their relationship was troubled and police were called to the home at least once to intervene in a domestic violence incident; Bly's husband accused her of slapping him, and she accused her of putting her in a headlock and banging her head on the ground. He had previously filed for divorce in June 2009, but withdrew the filing after he and Bly reconciled. Bly's husband passed a polygraph and he isn't considered a suspect in her disappearance. His divorce petition was granted in 2010 and he has sole custody of their daughters.

Bly fell off a horse a week before her disappearance. She told her mother she was having headaches after the accident and her mother advised her to see a doctor, but there's no evidence she ever did. Bly's mother speculated her daughter became disoriented due to her injury and wandered away. There is no evidence to support any theory, however.

Ashley Marie Carroll,"March 06, 2010","Albany, New York",24,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",140 lbs - 160 lbs,"Carroll was last seen when a friend dropped her off in the area of Quail Street and First Street in Albany, New York on May 6, 2010. She is from Troy, New York and had to Albany to see her boyfriend. They had been arguing through text messaging. Carroll's boyfriend stated he never saw her that day. Her mother, who lives in Rensselaer, New York, reported her missing.

Carroll reportedly planned to travel to New York City with a friend after she met with her boyfriend, and then return May 9, but there's no indication she ever arrived there. Authorities don't believe she ever made it back to her apartment in Troy, because all of her clothing and jewelry was left there, and she would have taken those things with her. She didn't have a car at the time of her disappearance and depended on others for transportation.

Carroll hasn't used her cellular phone since her disappearance; it was last tracked to a location near a friend's home on Marlborough Court in Albany. Her family doesn't believe she would have abandoned her one-year-old daughter.

Carroll is considered to be missing under suspicious circumstances. Police looking into the possibility that Anthony ""Inf"" Davis and Ricky ""L"" Thornton may have been involved in her case. Photos of Thornton and Davis are posted with this case summary. They were charged with kidnapping and conspiracy in the disappearance of marijuana dealer Steven Jackson, and Thornton was also charged with murder.

Several other defendants were also involved in the case. Davis pleaded guilty to kidnapping and testified against the others. Their first trial ended in a mistrial, and the second time they were acquitted of all charges. Davis and Thornton are also considered persons of interest in the disappearance of Donald Green. Like Carroll, Jackson and Green disappeared from Albany in 2010.

Both Albany and Rensselaer police are investigating Carroll's disappearance.

Lori and Tyrone departed the eatery at approximately 10:30 p.m.

Her husband told authorities that he and Lori had an argument after they returned to their apartment on New York Avenue and, at 2:00 a.m. on June 8, Lori went outside to smoke a cigarette and take a walk. She never returned and has never been seen again. Tyrone notified family members of her disappearance a few hours later, and they searched Lakewood in their cars before calling police.

Several months after Lori's disappearance, a clump of long human hair was found in Chautauqua Lake and authorities searched the water for her remains. No evidence was found and the hair turned out not to be hers. She left her purse, money and identification behind, and since her disappearance, she hasn't withdrawn any money from her bank account. At the time of her disappearance, Lori worked at Kay Jewelers at the local mall.

Tyrone never cooperated with the investigation and is considered a person of interest, but no charges have been filed against him or anyone else. Lori's mother died in 2010 without ever learning her fate, but her father is still alive. Tyrone remarried after her disappearance. In 2018, he, his second wife, and one of their young sons were all killed in a car accident.

Corrie Lynn Anderson,"October 28, 2008","Jamestown, New York",36,Caucasian / White,"5'11""",170 lbs,"Corrie was last seen at Lake City Dodge on Washington Street in Jamestown, New York on October 28, 2008. She stopped there to visit her boyfriend, then left at 1:10 p.m., driving her dark blue 2005 Dodge Caravan with the New York license plate number CX404. A photograph of a similar vehicle is posted with this case summary.

Corrie missed a scheduled meeting at 3:15 p.m. that day, and also didn't pick up her son for school. Items found at her home suggest she went there after leaving the car dealership. She has never been heard from again.

Her car was found abandoned on October 30, in a rural wooded area off Kortwright Road, south of Jamestown. It was parked near a gas well, out of sight from the road. This location is about a half-mile's walk or two miles' drive from her home.

Corrie was in the process of divorcing her second husband, Kenneth Anderson, when she went missing. They had separated approximately two years before, after Corrie found out he'd never legally divorced his previous wife. By the time of her disappearance, Corrie was seeing another man and planned to marry him in 2009.

Corrie told her loved ones Kenneth had abused her, and she took out an order of protection against him after he allegedly placed a tracking device on her car. He was arrested in 2007 for violating that order and was placed on probation. Corrie's fiance is not a suspect in her disappearance, but Kenneth is considered a person of interest in her case. Police questioned him and searched his home, without result.

Kenneth married again, for the sixth time, after Corrie went missing. In 2016, he was charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and rape after he allegedly took his new wife from New York to Kentucky against her will, raped her, and held captive in a hotel room, threatening to kill her if she tried to escape.

Anderson's purse disappeared with her and has never been located; authorities are interested in finding it. The purse is described as black, eight inches by eight inches in size, with a GH Bass & Company logo. Her keys are also missing.

Her disappearance is considered suspicious, as it's extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her cellular phone has been turned off since she went missing, which is also uncharacteristic of her behavior.

Anderson left behind two teenage daughters and a young son, and is described as a devoted mother. She worked from home as a medical transcriptionist and part time as a technical assistant at the Hultquist Library at Jamestown Community College in 2008. She has been known to visit Pennsylvania. Her case remains unsolved.

On December 24, 1999, nearly five years before she went missing, Cooper was beaten, raped and robbed of $225 by a stranger in her home in the 4700 block of Jarboe Street in Kansas City. She described the perpetrator is described as an African-American male in his mid-thirties, 5'10 and 160 pounds.

Authorities got a DNA profile of her attacker and filed six ""John Doe"" felony charges against the individual. Based on his DNA, investigators determined the man had also attacked two other elderly women in the Kansas City area, one incident occurring as recently as 2005.

It was rusty metal, about 3 feet high, with a ladder on the side. There were cows in the area. The water tank was located near the bank of an arroyo or dry stream bed. On Friday night, Maria fainted. She started bleedingÑ there was a lot of blood on her pants, so she changed into a pair of her son's pants (boy's pants, too big for her). She was able to continue until Sunday afternoon, when Maria fainted again and couldnÕt speak. They moved her under a big tree, in the shade. She was extremely weak, and told her son she couldnÕt go on. The coyote insisted that they had to go on, and they convinced her son to leave his mother (they told him another group was coming behind them, and would pick her up). The group met the truck 2-4 hours from where they left her. The truck picked them up and drove 6 hours to a farm/ranch. Another car met them there, and then there was a 2-3 hour drive to Phoenix.

Beaudry-Culver was married at the time of her disappearance, but her husband had thrown her out of their home because he was concerned about her using drugs around their three young children.

Stephanie's family members said that she failed to retrieve her paycheck before her disappearance. She was also looking forward to her boyfriend's release from prison, which occurred six months after she went missing. It's possible drugs were involved in her case; both Stephanie and the friend who accompanied her that night were drug users.

Two men claimed they were involved in Stephanie's case, but authorities determined that one of the individuals was imprisoned in March 1995 and the lead was cast aside. There have not been any arrests in connection with her disappearance, which remains unsolved.

Her boyfriend, Terrence Eugene Mobley, reported her missing, saying he last saw her at the Houston Mall on north Houston Road. She has never been heard from again.

At the time of her disappearance, Coates was a cadet with the Warner Robins Police Department. She left behind a young child.

In January 2010, police announced they were satisfied that Coates had been murdered and her body buried. Mobley, who is currently serving a life sentence in prison for another, unrelated murder, told them Coates went to the house in Hawkinsville, Georgia that she had once shared with him, and was killed in the kitchen.

A photo of Mobley is posted with this case summary. He stated his ex-girlfriend committed the actual murder, and he only disposed of the body.

When authorities pulled up the kitchen floor of the Hawkinsville home, they found bloodstains which were consistent with Mobley's story of how Coates met her death. He claimed he buried Coates in a wooded area off Industrial Boulevard in Hawkinsville, about four miles from where she was killed.

Investigators dug in the designated spot for days, but couldn't find any evidence. It had once been a pig farm, and it flooded in 1994; police believe heavy rains may have washed the remains away.

Authorities stated in 2010 that they expected charges to be filed in Coates's presumed homicide; however, no charges have been brought against anyone in connection with her case.

He stated they got into an argument and she left angrily at approximately 3:00 a.m., leaving their sixteen-month-old son behind. She has never been heard from again. Curry did not have a car; she had used public transit to get from her sister's home in Duluth, Georgia to Mujahid's home. He and Curry had a volatile relationship and he was once arrested after he allegedly punched her in the face and threatened her with a stun gun. He claims Curry was also violent towards him and once stabbed him with scissors. He didn't report her missing for three days.

Mujahid and Curry's family don't believe she would have abandoned her son, and her family stated it would be uncharacteristic of her to leave in the middle of the night and without calling anyone.

Curry was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, the youngest of five children. She attended Grant High School, where she played softball and ran track, then moved to Georgia during her senior year to live with her sister.

She graduated from Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Lithonia and, at the time of her disappearance, was studying online with the University of Phoenix for a degree in health care administration.

Although there's no hard evidence of foul play in her case, her loved ones don't believe she went missing voluntarily and they are afraid for her safety. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/12522

She left the residence with her boyfriend, Steven B. Bishop. The couple made some transactions at an ATM and a dollar store in the area after they left. Aragon has never been heard from again.

Her burgundy 1986 Subaru station wagon with the license plates number 286 PDE was later found abandoned on a hillside west of Lake Pleasant, Arizona, in area so remote it had to be accessed by helicopter. Some of her personal belongings were inside it. Her other vehicle, a 1990s pickup truck with faded green paint, is missing.

Aragon had two warrants out for her arrest at the time of her disappearance; she failed to appear in court on charges of drug possession and endangering the life or health of a minor. Bishop also has warrants out for him.

He was released from prison in 2004 after more than five years' of incarceration for aggravated assault, and after his released he failed to meet with his parole officer. He also failed to appear in court for sentencing on a domestic violence charge he had pleaded guilty to.

Bishop disappeared along with Aragon and has not been located. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. Although he was reportedly physically abusive towards Aragon, her family doesn't believe he was involved in her disappearance; they think whatever happened to her may have also happened to him.

Aragon was in the process of a divorce and custody battle at the time of her disappearance. Her family stated she'd been associating with criminals and drug addicts and didn't have a permanent home; she would stay with relatives in Gilbert, Peoria and Phoenix, Arizona for a few weeks at a time.

One of Aragon's ex-boyfriends stated he met her in August 2006, more than a year after her disappearance, and told her to contact the police. She never did and their alleged meeting has not been verified. This man later told police that Aragon's name had been on a ""hit list"" and that she was murdered.

Aragon's relatives are concerned for her safety and fear she may be deceased. She has three young children, one of whom was killed in a drunken driving accident four months before her disappearance. He was ten years old.

Aragon's loved ones stated she was deeply depressed over her son's death, visited his grave for hours on a daily basis, lost a considerable amount of weight and made statements about ""not wanting to be here anymore."" She told her stepmother she couldn't take care of her children and had to go away. Nevertheless, her family doesn't believe she would have taken her own life or willingly abandoned her surviving children.

When her stepsisters returned home, Mindi was gone and the front door was open. There were no indications of a struggle, and her purse, identification and other belongings were left behind.

The last person known to have seen Mindi was a clerk at the Circle K convenience store on the corner of University and Price; the clerk saw her make a phone call and leave. The clerk said a green and tan station wagon pulled into the parking lot and the driver grabbed Mindi, pulled her into the vehicle and drove away. She has never been heard from again.

Mindi's mother, Mary Xenos Chambers, was murdered in 1968, drowned in her bathtub at her apartment in Yonkers, New York. Mindi was two years old at the time. Police suspected her father, Allen Chambers, in Mary's death, but he was never charged for lack of evidence.

Mindi lived with her paternal grandmother and then with an aunt while Allen was serving time in prison unrelated charges of assault and attempted rape. When she was seven, Allen was released from prison and took her back into his care.

Mindi was a student at Mountain View High School in 1982. Three days before her disappearance, she told the police that Allen had been molesting her for the past five years. Child Protective Services (CPS) immediately placed her in the custody of her stepmother, who was in the process of a divorce from Allen. Then she disappeared.

No one reported Mindi missing until 1995. Her relatives stated she had a history of running away and they thought she had simply walked out of her life to escape her problems. CPS apparently dropped their investigation into her father a short time after Mindi went missing.

Allen died in a car accident in 1994, leaving behind six children besides Mindi.

Foul play is suspected in Mindi's disappearance.

http://charleyproject.org/case/kaylene-marie-gallegos

Gallegos left her father's Lakeside, Arizona residence on May 20, 2010. She got into a vehicle with two men, one of whom was Jacob Mata, and they went to Phoenix, Arizona to purchase heroin.

After the group bought the heroin, one of the men left and another woman joined Gallegos and Mata. They were on the way to Show Low, Arizona on State Route 87, when they got lost and ended up on a Forest Service road in the White Mountain Apache Forest.

At 8:00 p.m. on May 22, the three people arrived at an open area and stopped to decide what to do next. Gallegos and Mata wanted to stay where they were and wait to be found, but the second woman wanted to continue. She took the car and drove away, and Mata and Gallegos built a fire and spent the night where they were.

According to Mata, the next morning, the pair began walking, about fifteen to thirty yards apart from each other. They entered a small canyon and began climbing the side, and Mata reached the top of the ridge and saw a road. This was shortly after 1:00 p.m.

He called down to Gallegos and she called back to him, but he never saw or heard from her again after that. Mata searched the area for about 40 minutes, calling her name, but couldn't find her and decided to leave without her.

Three cars drove by, and he stopped them and asked for water, food and directions. He told the third vehicle's driver that Gallegos was lost in the forest. Mata eventually made it out of the forest, but he saw the police and tried to run away from them because he had outstanding warrants and was carrying both heroin and methamphetamine.

He was arrested, and it was about a week before investigators asked him to show them the place where he had last seen Gallegos. By then he could no longer remember the exact spot.

Gallegos and Mata's female companion backed up his story, but there have been rumors that Gallegos met with foul play and that her disappearance was drug-related. She's missing under unclear circumstances and her case remains unsolved.

She has never been heard from again. Her brother and sister-in-law in North Carolina reported her missing on January 21, 2009.

Due to her drug problem, Adkins didn't have custody of her two daughters, but she did keep in touch with them. She spoke to her family on the phone on a weekly basis and saw her relatives at least once a month. Her loved ones stated she had a pattern of living with family members for a few months as she tried to get clean, then eventually moving in with a boyfriend.

Shortly before her disappearance, Adkins wrote letters to her daughters talking about her life. She wrote that she was trying to find a new job, and talked about how her new housemate was treating her. She said had plans for a future with the man, and wanted to cook Thanksgiving Dinner for him and move into an apartment with him.

When authorities spoke to Adkins's boyfriend, he said she'd moved out of their apartment and he thought she was in Houston, Texas with a man she was talking to over Facebook. Police spoke to the man in Houston, but he said he hadn't seen Adkins in years.

Adkins has a warrant out for her arrest, issued in January 2009. She pleaded guilty to theft and drug possession in 2008 and was given a conditional suspended sentence, and is wanted for failing to comply with the terms.

Her parents reported her missing after they looked for her themselves for several hours without result.

Kimberly is described as a friendly and well-behaved teenager. She enjoyed children, music, dancing and computers in 1998. She was planning her Christmas shopping on the day of her disappearance and spoke to her father about it. She was a tenth-grader at Jefferson Davis High School in 1998.

Her case was originally investigated as a possible runaway due to her age. Investigators now believe she may have been abducted, but the circumstances surrounding her disappearance are unclear, as there are no known witnesses and no concrete evidence of foul play.

Kimberly's mother died in 2005, but her father is still alive and searching for her. Her case remains unsolved.

Brown disappeared the day before a major tornado struck the area, killing 42 people. The shopping center Brown was planning to go to was in the path of the storm. Her cellular phone records place her at Rosedale Apartments in the Rosedale Court area at 5:30 p.m. on the day of the tornado, and someone placed a call on her phone just minutes before the storm arrived.

After the tornado, 600 people were reported missing from the area; Brown is one of only four that remain unaccounted for. The other three are 28-year-old Teresa Marioquen and her two daughters, Yolonda Marioquen and Teresa Marioquen, who were both approximately 3 to 4 years old in 2011.

Brown's family doesn't believe she died in the tornado; they think she may still be alive. Her younger sister thought she saw Brown at The Playhouse, a nightclub in west Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but this sighting was never confirmed.

At the time of Brown's disappearance, she worked as an exotic dancer, hiding her occupation from her family, and she would occasionally travel out of town for her job.

At the time of her disappearance, she lived alone with her mother, Janet Gail Carter. A photo of Janet is posted with this case summary. She was originally from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was employed with an insurance company in Birmingham, Alabama in September 1973.

Janet disappeared at the same time as her daughter. She and Christina's father had gotten divorced two months before, and Christina's father was seeking custody of the child. Janet was dating a married man at the time of her disappearance, and said she was going on a trip to the Great Smoky Mountains with him. When she went Christina went missing, her family assumed they'd gone off on the trip to the mountains, or that Janet had taken Christina into hiding because of the custody dispute.

On October 7, Janet's nude, bound body was found inside a duffel bag alongside Clingmans Dome Road in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. She had been killed by suffocation the same day she was found. Her remains were not identified for a month, and it was only after this that authorities realized Christina was missing. An extensive search of the park turned up no indication of Christina's whereabouts.

According to Janet's family members, her married boyfriend was in the area where Janet's body was found around the time of her death, but his wife provided an alibi for him. The man is now deceased.

Because of the circumstances, authorities suggested Janet gave Christina to someone else to care for prior to her murder and Christina might still be alive.

Haleigh Breann Culwell,"June 21, 2007","Section, Alabama",11,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",110 lbs,"Haleigh and her mother, Kimberly Whitton, were last seen on June 21, 2007. They resided in a log cabin on a forty-acre property. The driveway leading up to the residence has two locked gates and as a result, the cabin can only be reached on foot.

The day she went missing, Kimberly went to her job at Cloverdale Manor Nursing Home in Scottsboro, Alabama to pick up some papers. She called a friend on the way back home to Section, Alabama, but they were unable to talk because the connection was bad. Kimberly promised to call her friend back in five minutes. She never did.

Kimberly's coworkers reported her disappearance on June 28, a week after she was last seen. Authorities interviewed her husband, Barry Van Whitton, who is Haleigh's stepfather. Barry stated Kimberly and Haleigh left their residence in a white Ford van or truck with Alabama license plates shortly after Kimberly arrived home from work. He said he gave his wife $20,000 in cash, and he never saw them after that. He stated they may have gone to Montana. They have never been heard from again.

Photographs of Barry are posted with this case summary. He had been married to Kimberly for eight years prior to her disappearance. He has a criminal record; he was convicted on charges of receiving stolen property in 1988 and 1991. After authorities searched his property for evidence in his wife and stepdaughter's disappearance, they arrested Barry on weapons charges. Guns were found on his property, and he is not legally permitted to own them due to his criminal history.

In September 2007, Barry pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. The typical sentence given for those charges is between 12 and 18 months, but the judge elected to sentence Barry to the maximum term due to the danger she believed he posed to the community; she described him as the most dangerous defendant she had seen in her judicial career.

The judge heard witnesses testify that Barry bragged about having murdered three people, discussed body disposal and removing trace evidence, and threatened to kill other individuals, including his mother-in-law and the judge who placed his eleven-year-old son in foster care after Kimberly and Haleigh's disappearances.

Barry is considered a suspect in Kimberly and Haleigh's cases, although he has never confessed to harming them. Authorities stated they found blood in one of his pickup trucks and on a hatchet handle, but the source of the blood has not been revealed.

Barry's first wife, Michelle Townsend Whitton, also disappeared in late 1997. At the time Barry said she, like Kimberly and Haleigh, had simply left; he said Michelle went out to get breakfast and never came back. A photo of Michelle is posted with this case summary. She was found beaten and stabbed to death and buried in a shallow grave in DeKalb County, Alabama six weeks later, in January 1998.

Barry and Kimberly met through a personals ad Barry placed in a magazine. They got married about a year after Michelle's death, after only four to six months of dating. It's unclear whether she knew his previous wife had been murdered or that he was considered a suspect.

While in jail on the gun charges, Barry allegedly told a cellmate he did not kill Michelle, but he knew who did and he had killed that person. In December 2014, a little less than a year before he was supposed to be released from federal prison, Barry was indicted for Michelle's murder. He was found guilty in September 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.

It's uncharacteristic of Kimberly and Haleigh to leave for an extended period without telling anyone. Kimberly had worked at the nursing home for seven years prior to her disappearance, and the only time she missed work was to take Haleigh on a school trip. Kimberly and Barry weren't having any known problems in their marriage in 2007, and Kimberly hadn't told anyone her husband was mistreating her. Barry hasn't faced any charges relating to their disappearances.

Kimberly and her daughter may have traveled to Montana after they went missing, but investigators suspect foul play was involved in their cases. Haleigh was a fifth-grade student at Macedonia School at the time she went missing. Her disappearance and her mother's remain unsolved.

She left home without taking her belongings with her. That day she sent a text message to her boyfriend, asking him to pick up their daughter. This was the last sign of her; she has never been heard from again.

Investigators believe Anaya's disappearance is connected to the disappearances of Josephine Vargas and Kianna Jackson. All three women frequented the same half-mile section of First Street, between Grand Avenue and the the 55 freeway, all of them were sex workers, and they disappeared within weeks of each other.

In April 2014, Franc Cano and Steven Dean Gordon were arrested and charged with the murders of Jackson, Anaya and Vargas, as well as the murder of 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, whose body was found in an Anaheim, California recycling plant.

Photos of Eastepp, Cano, Gordon are posted with this case summary. Both Cano and Gordon have prior records for sex offenses against children, and are registered sex offenders. They were wearing GPS ankle monitoring bracelets at the time of their disappearances and weren't supposed to be around each other.

At Gordon's trial in late 2016, he represented himself and admitted to being guilty of all the charges, although he said Cano had actually strangled the women. He said their bodies had been thrown in dumpsters.

Gordon stated he and Cano had also abducted and killed a fifth woman, but this victim was never located, and it wasn't until 2017 that authorities were able to identify her as Sable Pickett. At his trial, Gordon asked to be given the death penalty. He was convicted and sentenced to death. Cano has yet to be tried, and he has refused to cooperate with the investigation.

A neighbor saw Anguiano speaking to Adolfo Romo Martinez prior to the time she vanished. Martinez is her former live-in boyfriend and the father of her two toddler-age children.

The neighbor saw them talking for almost an hour; Anguiano had her back to wall and Martinez was standing directly in front of her with both hands against the wall, questioning her aggressively. Anguiano left her clothes inside the dryer and her children asleep in her apartment, which she shared with a cousin. She has never been seen again.

Martinez had physically abused Anguiano throughout their relationship; following their breakup, he continued to threaten her and occasionally was violent towards her.

He didn't want to support their children and questioned their paternity, although testing proved he was their father. After Anguiano's disappearance, authorities determined Martinez had lied about where he was at the time she vanished.

Authorities charged Martinez with Anguiano's abduction and presumed murder shortly after her disappearance. Martinez was convicted of second-degree murder and false imprisonment in July 2000, though prosecutors had not found Anguiano's body or any physical evidence. He was sentenced to eighteen years to life in prison and his appeal was denied in 2002. Anguiano has never been located.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lilia-edith-anguiano,-120.8581924,37.0634049

He disappeared after the murder and authorities believe he took Monica and Victor and ran. The couple's relationship had been troubled.

She was last seen sometime during February or March of that year. Brenda has never been heard from again.

Her mother claimed she had filed a missing persons report with law enforcement, but she had not actually done so. Brenda's sister eventually filed a report in 1994. Brenda's mother was strangled to death by a male acquaintance in 1981, a year after her daughter disappeared. Their home burned down sometime after 1980.

Brenda's home life was troubled. She had seven siblings, all of whom eventually ran away from home, and the family moved frequently between various residences on Staten Island. Her sister stated their mother and stepfather were both alcoholics and their father was incarcerated in 1980.

Brenda had been a special education student at Curtis High School, but stopped attending and was expelled as AWOL (absent without leave) in February 1980. There's an outstanding PINS (person in need of supervision) warrant for her in family court.

It's possible that Brenda may have been placed in foster care or in a group home after her disappearance as the result of alleged abuse. However, in 2008, one of her family members approached police and said Brenda had been murdered and her body was buried in the backyard of a house in East Islip on Long Island. Investigators dug up the backyard, but found only dog bones.

Brenda's case remains unsolved. She was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.

A month after Holly's disappearance, her mother, Holly Cederholm, received a phone call from a man who identified himself as ""Sal."" Sal told Cederholm he was holding the child captive and demanded that Cederholm meet him and perform sex acts on film in exchange for Holly's safe return.

Cederholm went with detectives to meet Sal at Penn Station in New York City, but he never showed up. She stated that she never believed Sal really had Holly; by this time, she thought Holly was dead.

Holly's parents have criticized the police for allegedly botching their investigation into the child's disappearance; they disregarded many witnesses who said they saw Holly because the witnesses had criminal records. Holly's half-brother is now a New York City police detective. Investigators deny any misconduct in Holly's case. Her family described her as a streetwise little girl who could take care of herself.

Andre Rand, a mentally incompetent convicted child sex offender from New York, was charged with first-degree kidnapping in connection with Holly's disappearance in 2001.

Rand, whose birth name is Frank Rashan, is also believed to be connected to the disappearances of Alice Pereira in 1972, Ethel Atwell in 1978, Tiahease Jackson in 1983, and Henry Gafforio in 1984, among other missing persons' cases. There is speculation that Rand may have been involved with the 1977 disappearance of Audrey Nerenberg as well.

All of the victims vanished from the Staten Island area, with the exception of Nerenberg. Authorities determined that Rand's aunt lived in the same Port Richmond apartment building where Holly's family resided in 1981.

Rand was previously convicted in connection with the 1987 New York kidnapping of a twelve-year-old girl named Jennifer Schweiger.

Officials searched the yard of Rand's former Vreeland Street residence in Staten Island in January 2002 but evidence related to Holly's case was not located. Authorities questioned Rand and searched his vehicle shortly after Holly disappeared, but he was not charged in her case until 20 years later.

Officers and inmates at the prison where Rand is currently incarcerated testified regarding conversations in which he allegedly bragged about his pedophiliac exploits. He reportedly confessed Holly's murder to an inmate and compared himself to the serial killer Ted Bundy.

Cederholm identified Rand's voice as the same voice she heard during the extortion phone call. Witnesses testified that they saw Rand's green Volkswagen circling the area of the store where Holly disappeared in 1981. Some say they even saw Holly in Rand's car.

He admitted to playing a hide-and-go-seek game with Holly on the day of her disappearance, and to giving her money to buy soap because she was ""dirty,"" but says he left her before she disappeared.

Rand's attorneys maintained that their client is innocent, and that the witnesses who claim to have seen Holly in his car are lying or mistaken. His lawyers attempted to throw suspicion on the child's family. Prior to her disappearance, Holly had been the subject of a custody dispute between her parents and had been taken by both of them at one time or another, but her parents have been ruled out as suspects in her 1981 disappearance.

Rand was convicted of kidnapping Holly in October 2004. Rand was never charged with the child's murder due to a lack of evidence. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. He is also serving 25 years to life for the Schweiger kidnapping. The second sentence makes it extremely unlikely that he will ever be freed. Rand maintains his innocence in all crimes suspected of him.

Tiahease Tiawanna Jackson,"August 14, 1983","Staten Island, NY",10,Black,"4'8""",90 lbs,"Tiahease Jackson was last seen leaving the Mariner's Harbor Motel on Forest Avenue in the New York City borough of Staten Island on August 14, 1983. She lived in the hotel with her mother and three siblings, the family having moved there after getting burned out of their apartment. The Jacksons planned to relocate to the southern United States.

At 1:30 p.m., while Tiahease's mother was asleep, another resident of the hotel sent Tiahease out to purchase chicken wings from the Crown Supermarket in the 900 block of Richmond Avenue. Tiahease never returned to the hotel and has never been heard from again. Her mother woke up at 4:30 p.m., and, discovering her daughter had been missing for three hours, immediately called police.

Tiahease's mother describes her daughter as streetwise and wary of strangers. She frequently went on errands in the city, sometimes with her sister or a friend and sometimes alone, and had been warned about predators. She has never been heard from again. Tiahease's mother and uncle both passed lie detector tests and are not considered suspects in her disappearance.

Andre Rand, a mentally incompetent convicted child sex offender from New York, is a prime suspect in Tiahease's case. Tiahease disappeared twelve days after Rand's release from a New York prison. He had a campsite at the Baron Hirsch Cemetery less than half a mile from the Mariner's Harbor Motel, and Tiahease's mother said she had seen a man matching his description loitering in the motel's parking lot.

Rand is also believed to be connected to the 1972 disappearance of Alice Pereira, the 1978 disappearance of Ethel Atwell, and the 1984 disappearance of Henry Gafforio, among other missing persons' cases. There is speculation that Rand may have been involved in the 1977 New York disappearance of Audrey Nerenberg as well. In 2004, he was convicted of kidnapping in the 1981 abduction of Holly Hughes.

Volunteers continue to search the abandoned property twice a year for evidence related to Rand's other alleged victims but nothing has been discovered. The Staten Island Developmental Center is two miles north of the site of Tiahease's disappearance.

Alice was playing in the lobby of the building with her brother. She vanished at approximately 3:30 p.m., after her brother left her alone for a brief moment.

Alice may have been sighted shortly thereafter in a park near the apartment building in the New Dorp area of the Island. She has never been heard from again. Her mother reported her missing at 6:15 p.m.

Her parents were separated at the time of her disappearance. She lived with her mother, and her father lived in Manhattan. Authorities at first believed the child's father had taken her, but he was later cleared as a suspect.

Andre Rand, a mentally incompetent convicted child sex offender, is a prime suspect in Alice's case. He worked as a painter in Tysens Lane Apartments at the time of Alice's disappearance.

She worked as a home health care aide and was leaving a patient's residence at the time of her disappearance. Elizabeth's patient told authorities that he witnessed two unidentified Caucasian men summoning her across the street as she exited the home.

Elizabeth has never been heard from again. Her 1986 Pontiac Grand Prix was discovered abandoned several blocks from the patient's residence on April 14, 1993, five days after she disappeared. Authorities said that the vehicle had been wiped clean of fingerprints by the time it was located. There was no sign of her at the scene.

Elizabeth had previously lived with her sister Linda, who was married to convicted automobile thief Charles Chorman. He was released from prison in December 1992, five months before Elizabeth disappeared.

Chorman initially assisted with the police investigation into his sister-in-law's disappearance.

Authorities began to re-examine Chorman's possible role in Elizabeth's case in 1998, when Chorman's girlfriend suddenly vanished from New York City. Anna Marie Scivetti was romantically involved with Chorman in the mid-to-late 1990's while he was still wed to Elizabeth's sister. Chorman had been arrested for abusing Scivetti in 1997. Scivetti's family believes she met with foul play. There has been no sign of her since 1998.

Authorities have not arrested anyone in connection with either Elizabeth or Scivetti's disappearances. Chorman has refused to cooperate with investigators, and there is no evidence of foul play in either case. Both cases remain open and unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/8230

She arrived at 6:00 a.m., parked behind Building 47 and locked her car.

Before she could get from the parking lot into her building, two female employees inside the building heard a male voice outside say ""Come on, come on,"" and Ethel say ""No, you'll beat me."" Then she screamed. The employees called the police after hearing the screams. The parking lot was still dark, the streetlights were off, and it was difficult for them to see anything.

When authorities responded, they found Ethel's tan pocketbook, one earring, one black shoe, three black coat buttons and half her set of dentures scattered on the ground at the left side of her car, which was locked. Her keys turned up in the woods about seventy-five feet away.

An extensive search of the area turned up no sign of her; Ethel has never been seen or heard from again.Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê ÊÊ
Andre Rand is considered a possible suspect in Ethel's disappearance. Rand, whose birth name is Frank Rashan, was convicted of the 1987 kidnapping of Jennifer Schweiger, a twelve-year-old girl with Down Syndrome who was murdered on the grounds of the Staten Island Developmental Center near his campsite, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. He was not convicted of her murder; the jury could not reach a verdict on that charge.

In 2004, Rand was convicted of kidnapping seven-year-old Holly Hughes; the child disappeared in 1981 and was never found. He is also believed to be connected to the disappearances of Alice Pereira in 1972, Tiahease Jackson in 1983, and Henry Gafforio in 1984, among other missing persons' cases.

Anna Marie Scivetti,"August 19, 1998","Staten Island, NY",34,White,"5'2""",115 lbs,"Anna Scivetti was last seen leaving Ferrar Foods, where she was employed as a receptionist, in South Plainfield, New Jersey on August 19, 1998. Scivetti was driving her blue/gray four-door 1988 Mazda with the New York license plate number 420-5GT or U20-5G2.

Traffic records indicated Scivetti drove over the Outerbridge Crossing and returned to the New York City borough of Staten Island, her place of residency. Phone records indicate she called Charles Chorman, her sporadic boyfriend of four years, shortly thereafter.

Later that day, Scivetti and Chorman were seen at a bar they regularly patronized. Witnesses said Scivetti looked as if she was in good spirits, but Chorman appeared to be brooding. This was the last time anyone saw her; she has never been heard from again. Early the next morning, a witness noticed Chorman was disheveled and his face and hands were scratched. He said he'd gotten into a bar fight.

Scivetti was scheduled to meet her new roommate for dinner and then pay her landlord for her new apartment in the Tottenville area. She left her dog and $1,000 behind in her temporary apartment. Scivetti's family said that it was highly uncharacteristic of her to leave without making arrangements for her pet's well-being and without announcing her travel plans. Scivetti's car has never been located.

Her loved ones believe that Chorman is responsible for Scivetti's disappearance. Chorman had been arrested and charged with physically assaulting Scivetti in September 1997, nearly one year prior to her disappearance. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of disorderly conduct and Scivetti won an order of protection from the courts at that time, which stated that Chorman was forced to stay away from her. However, they continued to see each other.

Chorman has a prior criminal record; in the 1980s he served four years in prison. Authorities said he was the mastermind behind a car theft ring that stole 500 vehicles.

Scivetti believed that Chorman was separated from his wife at the time they began their relationship in 1994. Chorman apparently kept two residences at the time, one with his wife and another with Scivetti.

Scivetti moved out of the home she shared with Chorman and her new apartment burned down shortly thereafter in what is referred to as a ""suspicious"" incident. Scivetti was preparing to move into her new, permanent apartment at the time of her August 1998 disappearance.

Chorman was rumored to have been romantically involved with his wife's sister, Elizabeth Bump, in the early 1990s. Bump vanished from New York City in 1993 and has never been located. He initially cooperated with authorities during their investigation into Bump's case at the time.

Chorman has never been arrested in either woman's disappearance, but he was convicted in an unrelated automobile theft case in New York in 1988. He maintains his innocence in both Scivetti and Bump's cases. Scivetti was declared legally dead in August 2005.

She had dropped out of Santa Ana High School prior to her disappearance and taken a job at a store. In the spring of 1960, she met 24-year-old Merle Avila. They married a month later and lived in Santa Ana.

Three months into the marriage, according to Merle, Henrietta packed her belongings and left him. She didn't get in touch with her family, and her father reported her missing on August 1.

Merle stated he saw his estranged wife in a park in Long Beach, California on August 20. On August 27, Henrietta's parents got a collect call from San Francisco, California, from someone identified as Henrietta Cruz. Henrietta's mother said she would accept the charges, but the caller hung up without speaking to her.

That same day, Henrietta's parents got a telegram from San Francisco, signed ""Henrietta."" It said she was okay, had gotten a job and would not be returning to her husband. Police determined the telegram had been phoned in from a payphone by a woman who gave a false address.

The week before Christmas in 1961, Henrietta's father went outside to his driveway and found, sitting on the trunk of his car, a belt and some underclothing belonging to Henrietta. There was no other sign of her and she never contacted her parents again.

Foul play is possible in her case, which remains unsolved. Santa Ana police are investigating.

Madeline Anna Babcock,"June 11, 1968","Los Angeles, California",35,Caucasian / White,"4'11""",105 lbs,"Babcock is hydrocephalic and requires spinal punctures every seven years to regulate her condition. She had her most recent puncture in 1947 at the age of 14, and is very overdue for the procedure. She may suffer amnesia as the result of her condition. In addition, Babcock had a problem with alcohol at the time of her 1968 disappearance.

According to Babcock's sister, Pat Foy, Babcock contacted her family for the last time at 4:00 p.m. on June 11, 1968 from her hometown of Los Angeles, California. Babcock called her mother from a pay phone and said that she planned to have a friend drive her to her mother's residence the following day, which was located approximately 20 miles from Babcock's Venice apartment. Babcock never arrived at her mother's home and has not been seen again.

Babcock was employed as a barmaid at Fred's Tavern and on an assembly line at a Plastic Glide factory (now out of of business), both in Santa Monica, California, at the time she vanished. Foy visited the bar when she failed to track down her sister within a few days. The owner of the bar says that Babcock did not report to work as scheduled during the first week of July 1968 and did not contact him

Foy and their mother stopped by Babcock's apartment on Flower Street in Venice later in the week. The landlord allowed them to go inside Babcock's residence and they discovered all of her personal belongings had been moved out. The landlord was unaware of any activity in the apartment during the preceding days and he did not realize Babcock had disappeared.

Foy and their mother contacted the authorities in Venice by mid-July 1968 to report Babcock as a missing person. Law enforcement was apparently unconcerned about her disappearance and believed Babcock left of her own accord. Babcock's case has been filed with several missing persons' agencies since that time; currently the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating. Her family says she was close to them and it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.

According to Foy, Babcock was abused by one of her former husbands. She was twice married and divorced at the time of her disappearance, and has four children. She did not finish high school. Her hobbies in 1968 included singing and playing the guitar. Babcock's family stated she was not close to them and it wasn't unusual of her to be out of touch with them for long periods. She apparently had very few friends in the Venice area. Foy continues to search for her sister.

Her daughter summoned authorities when Baker failed to arrive back at the camp by 10:00 a.m.

Investigators believe that Baker left the camp without a supply of water or protective clothing. The temperatures reached 90 degrees during the day with lows in the 60s during late August 2001. Authorities searched for Baker for five days, but the only evidence located was a footprint found near the camp.

Betty Balas,"December 13, 1980","Los Angeles, California",76,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",140 lbs,"Betty was last seen at her home on north Gardner Avenue in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles, California on December 13, 1980. She disappeared together with her husband, Louis, sometime between 6:15 and 9:00 p.m., and neither of them have ever been heard from again.

When authorities checked the Balas residence, they found the front door open and a set of keys still in the lock, the television set turned on, and the bathtub filled with water. There were no indications of a struggle and the only items that appeared to be missing were the couple's car and the car keys.

The Balases' maroon four-door 1978 Cadillac was found the next day in a vacant lot off Crenshaw Boulevard, near the Santa Monica Freeway and seven miles from the Balas home. There were no bloodstains in or on the vehicle.

The Balases vanished the day before Louis was supposed to testify against Larry Eugene Boyce, who on October 31, 1978, had allegedly attacked him in a bank parking garage, robbed him and threatened his life. Boyce, who had previously served eight years in prison for murder, was out on bail at the time Louis and Betty disappeared. In December 1980 he was scheduled to go to trial for a total of fourteen felonies, including kidnapping and robbing Louis.

Dozens of other witnesses were also scheduled to testify against Boyce, and it hasn't been proven that Betty and Louis's disappearances were related to the upcoming trial. He was ultimately convicted of a variety of charges, including kidnapping Louis, and sentenced to life in prison plus 33 years.

Foul play is suspected in the Balases' cases. Investigators believe up to three individuals, including a woman who may have been pregnant at the time, were involved in their disappearances. The cases remain unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/betty-balas,-118.3532748,34.0881595
Lynn Marjorie Bandringa,"May 29, 1967","Hesperia, California",21,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",119 lbs,"Bandringa was last seen in Hesperia, California on May 29, 1967. She disappeared from her home in the 13800 block of Main Street sometime between 5:15 and 5:30 p.m. She and her husband and father-in-law owned a trailer sales business, Bandringra Trailer Sales, and their trailer home also served as the business's office. She may have been painting a wooden fence in front of the business at the time of her disappearance; a paint can and brush were left behind there. Two witnesses reported seeing her cross Hesperia Road heading away from the trailer. She didn't take any clothing, purse, identification or other belongings with her, and she left her two pet dogs running loose.

Bandringa has gotten married for only seven weeks before her disappearance, and her husband said they were happy and he couldn't think of any reason she would want to leave. He was with his father on a service call in Barstow, California on the day she disappeared, leaving her home to mind the office by herself. She is missing under suspicious circumstances and authorities believe she could have been taken against her will.

Prior to her marriage, Bandrindga lived with her parents in Rialto, California. She is a graduate of Eisenhower High School and had previously worked for a San Bernardino credit firm. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lynn-marjorie-bandringa,-117.3614717,34.4268946

Catherine Marie Tornquist,"October 4, 2011","Hot Springs, South Dakota",55,Caucasian / White,"5'0""",130 lbs,"Catherine Tornquist was last seen in Hot Springs, South Dakota between 6:00 and 7:00 a.m. on October 5, 2011. She was carrying $10,000 in cash at the time of her disappearance and intended to purchase a motor home. She had already placed a $1,000 down payment. She never showed up to buy the motor home and has never been heard from again.

It's uncharacteristic of Catherine to leave without warning, and her daughter stated she would never have left because she was taking care of her elderly father. The contents of her purse were found dumped on a gravel road northeast of Buffalo Gap.

In July 2012, Catherine's son, Matthew Charles Tornquist, was charged with murder and grand theft in connection with his mother's disappearance. At his trial in the summer of 2014, the prosecution alleged he shot Catherine to death in her bed with a stolen .22 caliber rifle, dragged her body outside her home, put it in his car, disposed of it, and spent the money she'd intended to buy the motor home with.

Although someone had cleaned up the bedroom, traces of Catherine's blood were found on her bed and there was a trail of blood leading outside. There were two spent bullets in Catherine's mattress and another in the trunk of Matthew's car; they all had hair consistent with Catherine's stuck to them. There was a bloodstained sheet of plywood on Catherine's property and a partially burned cellular phone in the burn barrel.

One of the stolen guns found in Matthew's dormitory room, a .22 caliber rifle, had skin cells on it that matched Catherine's DNA, and her blood was found on a pair of his jeans. In addition, Matthew gave multiple stories to people about his mother's disappearance, and the alibi he provided turned out to be fictitious.

The jury deliberated only two hours before convicting Matthew of murder, although he maintained his innocence. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Catherine's body has never been found, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.","https://atg.sd.gov/docs/Missing%20Poster%20-%20Catherine%20Tornquist.pdf

She sold burritos and cosmetics at the club. She was together with Griselda Mata. Workmates last saw them with three men in a car, which, thanks to eyewitness statements, was identified by the authorities in the course of the investigation.

A week after Silvia and Griselda went missing, a complaint was lodged with the Procuradura General de Justicia de Chihuahua (PGJE), Office of the Chihuahua State Public Prosecutor, by Vernica Rivera who had been the victim of abduction and torture a few days before the two went missing. Vernica, who worked at the same bar as Silvia and Griselda, said that she had been kidnapped, tortured and released by her captors after being held for two days on 8 and 9 March. According to her testimony, one of her captors claimed to be a federal police officer from the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic (Procuradura General de la Repblica, PGR) and reportedly said that he would let her go on condition that she told no one about what had happened.

The Public Ministry and the four State Judicial Police officers officially assigned to the case carried out intense investigations and gathered several testimonies and other pieces of evidence that allowed them to corroborate the circumstances surrounding the method, time and place of Vernica's abduction. The vehicles and houses used were also identified and two men were identified as suspects in connection with the abduction of Silvia Arce and Griselda Mares.

On 6 April 1998 summonses were issued against the police officer from the PGR and another former police officer on suspicion of being responsible for the kidnapping of Vernica. After that, the investigations suddenly came to a halt. In five years there is no indication of further official steps having been taken to try to find out what happened to Silvia Arce and Griselda Mares or where they are.

In March 2003 the authorities reported that the case had been reopened at the end of 2002 but that they had been unable to locate those believed to be responsible.

Noquisi was raised by her mother, a single parent, and they moved all around the United States during Noquisi's childhood. They lived in Washington, Vermont, Florida, Oregon and New Mexico before moving to Hawaii in June 1995. Her mother describes Noquisi an extremely social person who made friends easily. She had been well-behaved and a good student, but shortly before her disappearance she her grades dropped and she started breaking rules and violating curfew.

Noquisi fought with her mother and finally dropped out of school altogether. She began dating a 25-year-old man, then moved out of her family's home and in with some friends. Her mother stated Noquisi began abusing drugs and alcohol at this time. She became pregnant, and her mother advised her to terminate the pregnancy. Noquisi had an abortion on October 9, just nine days before her disappearance.

Authorities believe that Noquisi may have left her home of her own accord, but the circumstances surrounding her disappearance remain unclear and her mother is not sure whether or not she ran away. She did not take any of her personal belongings with her, and her boyfriend said he had no knowledge of her whereabouts. Noquisi may have left Hawaii with a male companion after her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved. Noquisi's nickname is Quis. She may use the aliases D'Asia Noquisi, D'Asia Gunn, Sorrow Knight, Alex Gunn and/or Sorrow Terre Alex Gunn. Some agencies refer to her as ""Noquisi-Ama"" or ""Naquisi.""","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/4385?nav

Croft-Payne's friend stated she battled drug addiction and had lost custody of her child because of it. She also said Croft-Payne associated with a man who had previously threatened her life. Because of her lifestyle, there was concern for her safety. She frequented areas in Lewis, Grays Harbor and Pierce counties in Washington.

In November 2015, authorities announced they had reports from multiple witnesses that Croft-Payne had died of an accidental drug overdose in north Cowlitz County, Washington shortly after she was reported missing and her body was buried in a remote, heavily wooded area in Oregon.

They stated they had identified the people they believed had disposed of her body, but they weren't seeking charges against anyone in her death and only hoped to recover her remains to give her family closure. Her case remains unsolved.

12/24/1971Ê
Native American female. Black hair, brown eyes. Janice's ears may be pierced. She has a mole on her chin.

Details of Disappearance
Janice was last seen in Wapato, Washington in 1971. At the time of her disappearance, she was a sophomore at White Swan High School. Her hobbies included cooking, beadwork, and watching football. She is the oldest of seven children, and after her parents separated, she stayed with her father near Harrah, Washington while her six siblings joined their mother in Buena, Washington.

On December 21, 1971, Janice went to the hospital for treatment of numerous bruises on her head and chest. The surviving medical records don't identify which hospital she went to, or what the cause of her injuries was. Janice was discharged in satisfactory condition on December 24 and left. She never arrived home and has never been heard from again.

Many agencies incorrectly give the date of her disappearance as March 1, 1971, over nine months before it actually happened. One theory is that she ran away from home, but it's extremely unusual for a runaway to be gone for this long.

Both her parents are now deceased, but one of her younger sisters, who was eight years old at the time, has been active in the search for her. Her case remains unsolved.

Buenfil and an acquaintance, Terry Kenneth McDowell, were driving in the Big Scrub area of the Ocala National Forest on December 27, 2011. At 3:00 p.m., the vehicle became stuck in the sand on Railroad Grade Road just south of Forest Road 14. Buenfil walked south to get help, and has never been heard from again.

Bloodhounds tracked Buenfil's scent to U.S. 19, then lost the trail. She's described as a drifter who would stay at various different locations for weeks at a time. Authorities believe she may have caught a ride from someone. She left behind three daughters, who are in the custody of their father. She kept in regular contact with her children and it's uncharacteristic of her to abandon them.

Investigators believe Buenfil's disappearance is suspicious and McDowell, who like Buenfil had a drug history, is a person of interest in her case. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. McDowell died in a fire in April 2013, without disclosing anything more about Buenfil's disappearance.

Her disappearance may be connected to the disappearances of Megan Lancaster, Holly Logan, Wanda Lemons and Charlotte Trego, and the deaths of Tameka Lynch and Tiffany Sayre. Some of the women had places and people in common, and all were involved with drugs.

Mikelle Diane Biggs,"January 2, 1999","Mesa, Arizona",11,Caucasian / White,"4'8""",85 lbs,"Mikelle was last seen riding her bicycle near her family's residence in Mesa, Arizona on January 2, 1999. Mikelle and her younger sister thought they heard an ice cream truck's music in the distance and asked their mother for money. Mikelle and her sister waited for the truck near Toltec Street and El Moro Avenue at approximately 5:50 p.m. Her sister became cold and returned to the family's home for a coat. Their mother sent her back for Mikelle, but she had disappeared.

Mikelle's bicycle and her two quarters were found near the street where she had been standing. The bicycle was not at the corner, but partially back towards the house. It was lying on its side with the wheel still spinning. Mikelle and her sister had been separated for only about ninety seconds.

Authorities searched the entire area near Mikelle's family's home, but no evidence pertaining to her whereabouts was found. Search dogs lost her scent after only a few feet, suggesting she was placed into a vehicle and driven away. Authorities were unable to confirm if an ice cream truck was in the area at the time of her disappearance, but all ice cream vendors in the area were cleared of involvement in Mikelle's case. Known sex offenders in the vicinity were also cleared of any connection to Mikelle.

There have been many false leads in Mikelle's case. On January 9, police dug up what appeared to be a freshly-dug grave outside of Mesa. They found nothing. Two witnesses were put under hypnosis in hopes that they would remember something, but nothing came of that. A copper-colored jeep was reportedly spotted near Mikelle's home at the time she was last seen, but when its driver was located he was ruled out as a suspect and he had seen nothing usual.

Houses in the neighborhood were searched with the consent of their owners, but to no avail. Only one homeowner refused to permit a search; he is not considered a suspect. On March 10, 1999, a man reportedly tried to abduct two girls, a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old, from a schoolyard. Police thought the incident might have been connected to Mikelle's case, but the ""abduction"" was revealed to be a hoax.

Investigators have released sketches of two possible suspects in Mikelle's disappearance. Both images are posted with this case summary. The sketches were not widely publicized since authorities are not certain if the men are connected to her case.

Mikelle's father believes he knows who was reponsible for his daughter's apparent abduction. The man, Dee Blalock, lived two blocks from the Mikelle home in 1999. He had prior convictions for sex offenses in three states and was registered as a sex offender. In 2001, he was convicting of raping a neighbor and trying to kill her. He is presently serving a fifteen-and-a-half-year sentence in an Arizona prison.

A photograph of Blalock is posted with this case summary. His wife provided him an alibi for the time Mikelle disappeared, saying he was in their home garage the entire night. Mikelle's parents visited him in prison and asked directly if he had been involved in her disappearance, but he repeatedly told them he knew nothing about it.

Mikelle's family now lives in Gilbert, Arizona. On the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, her family held a funeral for her with an empty casket. They believe Mikelle was murdered shortly after her disappearance. No charges have been filed against anyone in her case.

Mikelle is described an intelligent, artistic, sociable person and an honor student. She played the clarinet and was a member of her school's student council at the time of her disappearance. She wanted to become an animator when she grew up. Her favorite color is purple and she has two younger sisters and a younger brother.

Danielle Arion Bell,"September 30, 2001","Pensacola, Florida",14,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",110 lbs - 120 lbs,"Danielle resided in Pensacola, Florida in 2001. She attended Tate High School and was a member of the cheerleading squad. She was popular at school in 2001 and enjoyed dancing and drawing. Her loved ones told investigators that she had friends who may have had a negative influence on her behavior at the time.

Danielle was last seen at a party Robert Louis Bassett Jr.'s residence on Cedar Tree Lane in Cantonment, Florida. The witnesses left the party that night, leaving Danielle behind with Bassett. Bassett, who was in his mid-twenties at the time, allegedly threatened another individual after Danielle vanished.

Investigators stated that the other male told officers that Bassett saw Danielle on September 30 and provided Bassett's contact information to law enforcement. Bassett allegedly stalked the individual for several days afterwards. He was arrested sometime after Danielle disappeared, but no charges have been filed against anyone in connection with her case. Authorities searched Bassett's residence after his arrest, but officials declined to publicly announce if any evidence was taken from the scene.

Witnesses said that Danielle visited a park on the corner of Escambia Avenue and Lakewood Avenue in Cantonment on September 30, 2001. The area where she was seen is near Bassett's house.

Prior to her disappearance, Danielle had been in a relationship with Alfredo Gomez Sanchez Jr. A photograph of Sanchez is posted with this case summary. He was later convicted of lewd and lascivious behavior and molestation in connection with his sexual activity with Danielle before she disappeared.

In the summer of 2007, Sanchez was charged with lying to investigators about his whereabouts at the time she disappeared. He had told authorities he was with his female cousin at the time Danielle went missing, and he had not seen Danielle for two or three weeks prior to his disappearance. Sanchez's cousin initially backed up his story, but later she recanted and said he had not been with her. Sanchez has not been implicated in Danielle's disappearance, however.

Danielle's disappearance remains classified a runaway, but foul play is now suspected in her case. She may have traveled to Panama City, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; or the state of Alabama. There is also a possibility that Danielle remained in the Pensacola area after her disappearance.

Some agencies may list September 28, 2001 as the date of Danielle's disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/danielle-arion-bell

Linda Kay Carroll,"September 25, 1984","Crestview, Florida",24,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",110 lbs,"Linda was last seen in Crestview, Florida on September 25, 1984. Her parents dropped her off at her home on Kingston Road at 8:30 p.m. About half an hour later, neighbors heard screams coming from her home, then a car speeding away. Carroll was reported missing the next day later, when she didn't show up for work at Showell Farms Inc. She has never been heard from again.

Linda never picked up her last paycheck. Her purse and shoes were missing from her home. Her bed had been stripped and the sheets were missing, and there were clumps of hair scattered. A note addressed to Linda's brother was on the counter; it said she'd gone to Baker, Florida to do laundry and that he should wait for her. He was supposed to visit her the day of her disappearance, but didn't make it.

Linda was going through a divorce and custody battle at the time of her disappearance. Dennis Wayne Carroll, her husband of five years, had left her in August and taken their two young children, which upset her, as she was a devoted mother.

Dennis admitted he stopped her home on the night of September 25. He said she wasn't home, so he left and went to his mother's house in Meridian, Mississippi. Dennis is a suspect in Linda's disappearance, but he was never charged in her case and he died of cancer in 2014.

Linda was living alone at her Kingston Road home, which didn't have electricity. She lived frugally because she was saving money for a divorce attorney. She was working at her first job and had gotten a driver's license, although she didn't yet own a car. Her family describes her as an introvert with few friends. Her disappearance remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.","http://charleyproject.org/case/linda-kay-carroll

Teresa Lynn Butler,"January 25, 2006","Risco, Missouri",35,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",110 lbs,"Teresa is believed to have disappeared from her residence on County Road 241, also known as Eight Ditch Road, just off of Highway 62 near Risco, Missouri on January 25, 2006. She was last heard from when she spoke to a relative on the phone at 10:00 p.m. the previous day.

Teresa's husband, Gary Dale Butler, was working the night shift and tried to call her on his lunch break, but the call went to voicemail and he assumed she was asleep. He came home at 10:00 a.m. on January 25 and found his wife missing and their two sons, aged two and four years, home alone. The younger boy had a full diaper and an empty bottle. Teresa has never been heard from again.

The family's video camera, PlayStation with games, Nintendo GameCube with games, large MagLite flashlight, digital camera and car stereo disappeared with Teresa, along with her purse and cellular phone, but her wedding rings, black leather jacket and her forest-green Jeep were left behind.

She normally took off her wedding rings every night before bed; the rings were found on the floor under the couch. There were no signs of forced entry to the home and no blood or indications that a struggle had taken place, but a key was found broken off in a lock at the residence, and the lightbulb on the front porch was unscrewed.

Cellular phone records revealed that a call was placed from Teresa's phone at 3:16 a.m. on the day of her disappearance, to a residence in Gideon, Missouri. The man who lived there did not answer the phone at the time. He said he didn't know Teresa or anyone in her family.

After her disappearance, her cellular phone was used to place a call to Clarkton, Missouri, to a home where two elderly women lived together. The women don't know Teresa either and stated they answered the phone but heard nothing from the other end. Authorities are uncertain why the calls were made.

Gary stated his wife was not having any problems prior to her disappearance, but her coworkers stated she had received upsetting phone calls from Gary's ex-wife. She told her father that Gary's ex-wife had threatened her. Gary has been ruled out as a suspect in her case, and maintains that the differences between Teresa and his former wife were amicably resolved.

A witness came to police and told them about a drug deal that supposedly happened within 24 hours of Teresa's disappearance, where drugs were exchanged for a video camera. After viewing its contents, the witness realized it was Teresa's. The police were able to recover the video camera in the spot the witness indicated, a water-filled ditch between Malden and Risco, but it had no serial number and there was no tape inside, so they couldn't prove it was Teresa's.

In November 2019, Melvin Ray Hufford Jr. was charged with first-degree involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering in Teresa's case. A photo of Hufford is posted with this case summary. Authorities stated he had been a person of interest in her case since shortly after she disappeared, and that he had confessed to causing her death.

According to Hufford's statement, he, another man and Teresa were getting high on methamphetamine the night she disappeared. After he injected himself and her, she said her chest was hurting, then passed out and died. He then wrapped her body in a tarp and took it to a ditch, then stole items from her home to make her disappearance seem like a robbery.

Later, Hufford took Butler's body to his father's old abandoned house and hid it under a sink cabinet for a few years while he was in prison. After his release, he burned her remains, crushed the remaining bones and dumped them in a ditch. Hufford's father stated he had seen the body under the sink but hadn't touched it.

Hubbard is awaiting trial in Teresa's death. He has an extensive felony record, including drug offenses, and has served six prison sentences since 1997. Investigators don't believe the second man he implicated in Teresa's death was actually involved in her case, and they don't anticipate making any further arrests.

Teresa has no history of instability or of leaving without warning, and it would be uncharacteristic of her to leave her children unattended. She was employed in the photo department of Wal-Mart in Dexter, Missouri at the time of her disappearance, and was scheduled to work at noon on the day she went missing, but never showed up. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/teresa-lynn-butler,-89.827817,36.548935
Regina Marie Bos,"October 17, 2000","Lincoln, Nebraska",40,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",105 lbs,"Bos arrived at Duggan's Pub on 11th Street and K Street in Lincoln, Nebraska on the evening of October 16, 2000. She is a musician and often participated in Open Mic Nights at the pub.

Witnesses at Duggan's Pub said that Bos was in good spirits during the evening. Her ex-husband saw her there and they spoke for awhile before left at 10:00 p.m. She departed the club at approximately 1:00 a.m. on October 17, telling friends she planned to pick up her boyfriend at his residence and then proceed home to be with her three children for the rest of the night.

Witnesses said that Bos had her guitar and music with her when she left the pub, but it is unclear if she was carrying her purse. Bos never arrived at her boyfriend's home as planned.

Her boyfriend fell asleep waiting for her and when he woke up at midnight, she still hadn't arrived, so he assumed they'd talk in the morning. He woke up a few hours later and paged her multiple times. Bos's pager was at home, and the sound of it going off woke up her children. When they realized she hadn't arrived home, they called their father and their maternal grandparents.

Bos's boyfriend called her children at approximately 6:30 a.m. At 6:38 a.m., he called the police, and her loved ones hired a private investigator to attempt to locate Bos.

Her Saturn was discovered parked across the street from Duggan's Pub later in the day. There was no sign of Bos at the scene, but her guitar and sheet music were inside the trunk, which was slightly open. Bos's purse was not found at the scene.

Bos's loved ones said it was extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her sister describes her as a multi-talented woman and stated she had just gotten a job as a manager at a FedEx Kinko's store in Lincoln, Nebraska. She had been divorced twice, amicably.

Authorities have stated that Bos's disappearance is suspicious. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/67

Katelin Michelle Akens,"December 5, 2015","Spotsylvania, VA",19,White/Causasian,"5'4""",120-130 lbs,"On December 1, 2015, Katelin Michelle Akens flew across the country from her home in Arizona to visit her family in Virginia. She had been eagerly anticipating the arrival of her nephew, and wanted to see him as soon as he was born. Four days later, on December 5, 2015, 19-year-old Katelin was supposed to fly back home to Arizona, but she never boarded her flight. A few days after she disappeared, her luggage was found on the side of a Virginia road with her wallet, identification, cash, and plane ticket, but there was no sign of Katelin. On the afternoon of her disappearance, Katelin texted a couple people but they found the texts to be strange and didn't believe the messages came from Katelin. The last person to see Katelin was her former stepfather, James Branton. He says he last saw Katelin when he dropped her off at a mall several hours before her flight, but has refused to take a polygraph and law enforcement has struggled to break the encryption on his phone.

Khadijah Rose Britton,"February 9, 2018","Covelo, California",23,Native American (Round Valley Indian Tribe),"5'8""",150 lbs - 180 lbs,"Britton was last seen in Covelo, California on February 7, 2018. She was visiting a friend in the 23000 block of Airport Road that night when, according to a witness, Britton's ex-boyfriend, Negie Tony Fallis IV, and his new girlfriend, Antonia Bautista-Dalson, pulled up in a black Mercedes.

Fallis was armed with a small Derringer pistol. He went to the door of the house and demanded that Britton come out and speak to him. A physical altercation ensued and Fallias chased Britton around the car, which was being driven by Dawson. Fallis hit Britton and shoved her into the car, and Dawson sped away with them all inside. Britton has never been heard from again.

Photos of Fallis and Dawson are posted with this case summary. Fallis's relationship with Britton was tumultuous and he was known to be abusive, and they had recently broken up. He also has a history of domestic violence charges related to other women.

About two or three weeks before Britton's disappearance, Fallis had attacked her with a hammer and attempted to abduct her in an incident very similar to her later kidnapping. Britton filed a complaint against Fallis for this, and due to his prior criminal history, could have gone to prison if convicted in this incident. However, only hours before her disappearance, Britton went to the police and said she didn't want to pursue charges. Her family believes Fallis coerced her into doing this.

The witness to Britton's February 7 kidnapping did not come forward with their story for several days, until after Britton's family realized she was missing. Ten days after she was reported missing, Fallis was charged with assault, kidnapping, first-degree burglary, threats to commit a crime resulting in death or great bodily injury, attempted murder, and being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in Britton's disappearance.

He pleaded not guilty and refused to cooperate with the investigation into Britton's disappearance. In June, the authorities were forced to drop most of the charges against him for lack of evidence. His bail was reduced and he was released not long afterwards, although he still faced the charges of possession of gun and ammunition. In August, Bautista-Dalson was arrested for felony suspicion of harboring or concealing a wanted felon, Fallis.

In October 2018, Fallis pleaded no contest to being a felon in possession of a firearm, and Bautista-Dalson pleaded no contest to being an accessory to a felony. Fallis was sentenced to four years in prison, and Bautista-Dalson to eighteen months in jail and eighteen months of supervision. She was ordered to have no contact with Fallis and to spend six months in an inpatient drug rehabilitation program.

Both the police and Britton's family believes she was murdered, and Fallis remains the prime suspect in her case. Authorities hope to find Britton's body.","https://oag.ca.gov/missing/person/khadijah-rose-britton

Shariece was last seen between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. She had been babysitting her six younger siblings at the family's residence in the 2800 block of Round Road in the Cherry Hill neighborhood when her mother's ex-boyfriend, Dennis ""Demo"" Queen, came to the house. He said Shariece left at this time. Her phone pinged downtown that evening, but none of her friends saw her.

Joanna was last seen late that evening. She had been out on a date and called a friend to ask for a ride home, then called back to say she was taking the bus instead. She spoke to her friend as she was arriving at her house and promised to call her again later. This was at 11:00 p.m. Neither Joanna nor Shariece has ever been heard from again.

A photo of Queen is posted with this case summary. He said he was drunk and asleep and woke up at approximately 11:15 p.m. when someone came in, but he couldn't remember who it was. When he woke up in the morning, both Joanna and Shariece were gone. Neither of them have ever been heard from again.

Queen made no attempt to report them missing and never asked anyone where they had gone. A family friend filed the missing persons report three days later, after she found out Joanna had missed work on February 6 and 7 and Shariece hadn't been to school. $800 in cash, which Joanna had been saving for the rent, went missing with them.

Joanna and Queen had a long, troubled relationship; he began seeing her when Shariece was a toddler, and was the father of Joanna's six younger children, who were between the ages of two and ten when their mother and sister disappeared. Joanna was a reliable worker at the Goetze's Candy Company, but Queen was unable to hold a job for very long and was frequently unemployed.

According to Joanna's loved ones, Queen had been abusing and stalking her for years. He also treated Shariece differently than the other children and had physically abused her before. Joanna repeatedly tried to leave him. She got a restraining order against him in September 2016, and it was still active in February, but Joanna had Queen back into the house to watch their children so she could go to work.

Shariece deeply disliked Queen and never wanted to be in the house with him if her mother wasn't there. She had also begun spending the night in her mother's room. About a week before the women disappeared, Queen made sexual advances to Shariece and she told her mother. Joanna told him he had to leave, and said she would put all his belongings out on the street by February 4. This was the day she disappeared.

Both of them were active on social media, but there hasn't been any activity on their social media accounts or their cellular phones since they went missing. Joanna's loved ones stated it would be uncharacteristic of her to abandon her other children, and Shariece has no history of running away from home.

Joanna's other children were placed in foster care after their mother's disappearance. They have not provided any useful information about the day she and Shariece disappeared. Queen's brother took a lie detector test in the women's cases; the result was inconclusive. Queen refused to take the test.

The police have not named Queen or anyone else as a suspect or person of interest in Joanna and Shariece's disappearances and said there was little ""overt evidence"" of a crime in their cases, but they stated they thought the women had met with foul play.

She was supposed to clean and do chores for the man until she found a job and could pay rent, but he asked her to leave, so she checked into a hotel.

Mahfuza RahmanÊ Ê*,"December 8th, 2015","Bronx, New York",30,Asian,"5' 3"" - 5' 5""Ê",100 - 135 lbs,"Mahfuza was last seen in New York City on December 8, 2015, leaving work from Bellevue hospital.. She lived on east 198th Street in the Kingsbridge Heights area of the Bronx. She worked as a nurse at Bellevue Hospital at the time of her disappearance. The day of her disappearance, she went to work, then went to class at Hunter College, then arrived home. She has never been heard from again.

Mahfuza was supposed to show up for work on December 10, but never did. The hospital authorities contacted her husband, Mohammad Chowdhury, who said Mahfuza had gone back to her native Bangladesh the previous day because her parents had been seriously injured in an accident.

When Mahfuza had still not returned to work by December 14, the hospital police went to her apartment and spoke to Chowdhury. He changed his story slightly, saying Mahfuza had left for Bangladesh that morning to see her parents, who had been critically injured and were not expected to live. He said she would come back to work in March.

Later that day, Chowdhury flew to Bangladesh with the couple's nine-year-old daughter. They had been Mahfuza's only relatives in the United States; the rest of her family lived in Bangladesh.

The police began investigating Mahfuza's disappearance on March 4, nearly four months after she was last seen, after she didn't return to work as Chowdhury had said she would. They contacted Mahfuza's parents and learned they hadn't been in a car accident and hadn't heard from their daughter since the day before she was last seen. Chowdhury had told them Mahfuza had left him for another man.

There was no documentary evidence that Mahfuza had left the United States at all. Authorities were suspicious and searched the family's residence. The basement was flooded from a broken pipe and the walls had been freshly painted. Authorities dug up the freshly poured patio, but found no evidence there. They did find Mahfuza's clothes, wallet, credit cards and passport inside the house.

They repeatedly tried to contact Chowdhury, but weren't able to reach him until later that month, when he called them from Bangladesh. He told them his marriage had been troubled, and said he wanted to return to New York and he thought Mahfuza's family was going to kill him.

Chowdhury is known to have purchased a sixteen-inch camping ax and packing tape on the morning of December 10, just hours after Mahfuza was last seen. He has not returned to the United States. The couple's daughter now lives with Chowdhury's mother, and Chowdhury has remarried.

Police believe Mahfuza is dead; they stated she was a person of very regular habits and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her coworkers described her as a very religious Muslim and a private person who sometimes talked about her daughter, but never even mentioned her husband.

She had studied chemistry at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh, then got an associate's degree at LaGuardia Community College before transferring to Hunter College, where she was studying for a bachelor's degree in nursing. Authorities have named Chowdhury the prime suspect in her disappearance and are trying to build a murder case against him.

Jennifer Rayleen Casper-Ross,"May 5, 2005","Reno, NV",30,White,"5'9""-5'10""",130-135 lbs,"Jennifer was last seen at approximately 5:30 a.m. on May 5, 2005, at the Reno Sparks Cab Company, her mother's place of work, in the vicinity of the 400 block of Gentry Way in Reno, Nevada. She stopped by there to visit her mother, but her mother was not working at the time.

Jennifer was intoxicated and didn't have enough money to pay her cab fare. She ran from the taxi, climbed over a fence at the back of the establishment and disappeared. She has never been heard from again.

The night before her disappearance, Jennifer's husband, Sean Ross, came home and found her drunk and saying she needed to leave. She had her belongings and family photos packed. Sean initially tried to change her mind, but he let her go after Jennifer insisted. She went to the Peppermill Hotel and Casino with a friend early on the morning of her disappearance. Witnesses reported she had self-inflicted cuts on her arms and wrists.

Jennifer was unemployed at the time of her disappearance; she had worked as an exotic dancer, but had been terminated from several jobs due to her substance abuse. She was fired from her last job a week before her disappearance. She had previously been a professional ballerina. That career ended due to a tailbone injury, but she still gave ballet lessons.

Jennifer was deep in debt at the time of her disappearance, and her credit cards were maxed out. She left her broken high heels behind and two notes, one stained with her own blood. The notes directed who should be permitted to have contact with her young son if anything should happen to her, and stated her possessions should go to Sean.

Jennifer was raised in Pocatello, Idaho and graduated Highland High School there; she moved to Reno in 1995. She attended Truckee Meadows Community College and then transferred to the University of Nevada at Reno. She was a Dean's List student and majored in veterinary medicine before switching to biomedical engineering. She also tutored in physics and mathematics. She was one year away from completing her degree at the time of her disappearance, and had dreamed of finding a cure for autism or cancer.

Sean stated Jennifer suffered from postpartum depression after their son's birth and became addicted to drugs and alcohol. She has previously attempted suicide and had gone missing before for several days at a time, though never for this long.

Sean has cooperated with authorities in the investigation and is not considered a suspect in Jennifer's disappearance. He filed for divorce three months after her disappearance and is raising their son.

A few minutes before she vanished, Jennifer called her father in Las Vegas, Nevada and said she needed to go to that city, but she apparently never arrived there.

It is uncharacteristic of Jennifer to leave without warning and her mother believes she met with foul play, but the circumstances surrounding her disappearance are unclear.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/170

 The suspect identified in connection with her case, Keith Glenn Hescock, a tool salesman, shot and killed himself following a shootout with police at the end of a 40-mile pursuit through Heise, Kelly Canyon and then into Madison County nine months after Hoopes disappeared.

 Police were waiting for Hescock when he returned home after a 14-year-old girl that he had kidnapped earlier that June morning managed to escape from his house and led police to his residence.

 The girl was sleeping outside on a trampoline at her rural Bonneville County home with her sister when Hescock abducted her. The sister, who was unharmed, slept through the kidnapping.

They hitchhiked together to the Banana Fish nightclub (now defunct) on 96th Street and 3rd Avenue that evening, then separated once inside the club.

Cuccia's friend saw her getting into a car two unidentified Caucasian men at 9:00 p.m. The friend described the men as ""hard looking"" and said their car was a blue with a metallic finish and Massachusetts license plates. She may have been forced into it. She has never been heard from again.

Amber Nicole Crum,"December 26, 1983","Dallas, Texas",2,Caucasian / White,"2'4""",25 lbs,"Amber was seated inside of a pickup truck in Dallas, Texas on December 26, 1983. The truck belonged to her mother's live-in boyfriend, James Britton ""Britt"" Monroe. It was parked outside of McDonald's Grocery in the 800 block of Murdock Road, two blocks from their home, at approximately 9:45 a.m. that morning.

Monroe says he went inside the store to purchase soft drinks and paper towels and left Amber in the truck alone for two to five minutes. When he returned, she had vanished. Amber has never been heard from again.

Three weeks after Amber's disappearance, police filed murder charges against Monroe in connection with her case. There was evidence that she was abused before her disappearance; various people saw bruises on her and there's a photograph of her with a hand-shaped bruise on her face.

Amber's mother, Stephanie Hughes (also called Stephanie Crum or Stephanie Hughes Crum), initially told police her daughter had been very cold, with her eyes open and unblinking, when she checked on her at 9:30 p.m. on Christmas night, and she believed Amber was dead.

Hughes subsequently recanted and said Amber had been alive on Christmas night and the police had pressured her into making her previous statement. Another witness said he spoke to Monroe on the phone on the morning of December 26 and heard Amber talking in the background.

A judge dismissed the charges against Monroe a short time later on grounds of insufficient evidence, and they were never refiled, although police said he gave inconsistent statements about the events leading up to Amber's disappearance and they didn't believe he disclosed everything he knew. Monroe maintains his innocence in Amber's case.

He and Hughes parted ways after Amber disappeared and Hughes moved to Indiana. She and Amber's father had separated in 1982 and their divorce was final on December 1, 1983. He was in Kentucky at the time. He had never been very much a part of his daughter's life and was quickly ruled out as a suspect in her disappearance.

In 1986, investigators checked the fingerprints of a girl who was abandoned in California that same year. The girl matched Amber's general physical description and was about the right age. Their fingerprints did not match, however.

In 2007, authorities announced they considered David Elliot Penton a person of interest in Amber's disappearance and in the disappearances and murders of several other young girls, including Angelica Gandara and Ara Johnson. A photograph of Penton is posted below this case summary. He is has been incarcerated in an Ohio prison since 1987. He also signed a plea agreement admitting to the murders of three girls in Texas.

The Texas victims disappeared over a period of 18 months in the Dallas area, and ranged in age from 4 to 9 years old. Penton was also convicted of manslaughter in the child abuse death of his own infant son in 1984; he fled while free on bond pending the outcome of his appeal, and remained at large until 1987, when he was charged with the murder of a friend's 9-year-old niece in Ohio. He was later convicted of this crime.

Penton's cellmates went to investigators and claimed he had implicated himself in the disappearances of Ara, Amber and Angelica. He has not been charged in connection with any of these disappearances, however. All the cases, including Amber's, remain unsolved.

She returned to the dealership later during the day to retrieve her vehicle. She was supposed to drive it directly to K&K Seafoods in Chester, Maryland, where she worked as a waitress.

Anderson has never been heard from again. She was normally a very reliable worker and her boss became concerned and contacted police when she did not arrive at work and did not call to say she would be late or absent.

Anderson's van was later found at in a shopping center parking lot in Glen Burnie, Maryland. From the mileage log investigators determined it had been driven 45 miles between the time it left the dealership and the time it was parked in the lot. There was no sign of Anderson at the scene. She is believed to have been carrying no credit cards and only about $20 in cash when she went missing.

Anderson was a student at the University of Maryland at the time of her disappearance. She lived with her boyfriend in Chester. Her parents lived near Boston, Massachusetts. Anderson and her boyfriend were scheduled to travel to Pennsylvania for a family reunion a few days after her disappearance.

Dean Marie Pyle Peters,"February 5, 1981","Grand Rapids, MI",14,White,5'2-5'3,110 lbs,"Dean was last seen at at Forest Hills Central Middle School in the 5800 block of Ada Drive southeast in Grand Rapids, Michigan at 5:00 p.m. on February 5, 1981. She was at her six-year-old brother's wrestling practice with her mother when she said she was going to the women's restroom and would be back shortly. She never returned and has not been heard from since.

Dean apparently never arrived at the restroom; no one saw her anywhere near there. She was last seen walking out the door of the gymnasium; accounts differ as to whether she was going to a friend's home or merely wanted to smoke a cigarette. She left her wallet, purse, makeup, jewelry, clothing and several hundred dollars behind at home.

Arthur Diaz, the school's custodian, was considered a possible suspect in Dean's disappearance for many years. He stated he was cleaning a school office the night of her disappearance and never saw her.

Authorities checked the school incinerator on the theory that someone might have tried to burn her body, but found no evidence. Diaz is no longer a suspect in Dean's case.

Another suspect is a local man, Bruce Bunch, who was seventeen years old and a high school junior in 1981. Over twenty years after Dean's disappearance, a female acquaintance of Bunch told police he told her a story about running over a girl at a school.

Bunch allegedly said he either ran or backed over the girl, took her body to Snow Avenue and buried it under a pile of rocks. This story has not been confirmed, but Bunch remains a suspect in Dean's disappearance.

His first wife stated he was violent and abusive towards her and, after drinking heavily, would sometimes black out and have no memory of what he did. She stated he once pushed her out of a moving vehicle and broke her ankle, and on another occasion threatened to run her off the road.

Bunch died of a heart attack in 2008. He was never charged or questioned in Dean's case. In 2011, authorities announced they believe he was responsible for Dean's death.

Two days before she went missing, Dean had a physical altercation at school with two other girls. They were fighting over a boy, and the two girls allegedly threatened Dean and told her to stay away from him. It's unclear whether the incident had anything to do with her later disappearance.

Dean wasn't having any serious problems with her family when she disappeared, she was a good student, and she does not have a prior history of running away from home. Several possible suspects were questioned after her disappearance, but no one has ever been charged.

She was an eighth-grader in 1981, and aspired towards a career as a model. She's originally from California, and her biological father lived there in 1981. Her mother and stepfather, with whom she lived, moved to Arizona after her disappearance. Her stepfather has been ruled out as a suspect in her case.

Dean was declared legally dead in 1991. In 2008, authorities reopened the investigation into her disappearance and appealed for anyone who was at the school that day to contact them. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/dean-marie-peters,-85.5236111,42.9491003

She was riding with her husband, Paul, in his gray 2000 Ford F-150 pickup truck at the time. The couple were having marital problems and she had moved out two months before, but they were trying to reconcile.

At 9:33 a.m., an acquaintance called Rachel's cellular phone. Paul answered and seemed upset. The caller was unable to speak to Rachel. At 10:20 a.m., a witness saw Paul at his home alone. He drove there, stayed only a few minutes, and then drove away again. Rachel has never been heard from again.

Paul disappeared at the same time Rachel did. Their loved ones became concerned and contacted authorities, who began searching for them. Police found his truck near his home on March 15. Rachel's cellular phone, wallet and medication were inside it.

On March 16, authorities located Paul's body in the woods off Briarpatch Lake Road, about 500 yards from his home and near where the truck had been recovered. He had shot himself. There was no sign of Rachel at the scene and an extensive search of the area turned up no indication of her whereabouts.

Rachel left behind a thirteen-year-old daughter, who is now living with her paternal grandmother. The daughter described Paul, her stepfather, as abusive, and stated her mother loved her and would never have abandoned her.

She didn't show up for work at the Carroll Subway the next day. She had worked there for 21 years and had never been late or missed work before. Because of this, her boss reported her disappearance to police immediately. She has never been heard from again.

The morning after Allen's disappearance, her white 2001 Chevrolet Blazer was found locked and abandoned in the parking lot of the Piranha Club in the 1200 block of Plaza Drive. It hadn't been there when the club closed at 10:30 p.m. the previous day. There were no signs of a struggle at the scene, or at her home. Cellular phone records indicate her phone was used for the last time at 3:30 a.m. on May 5, then turned off a few hours later.

Allen was in the process of an amicable divorce and was dating a 54-year-old married man, James Snovelle, at the time of her disappearance. They had met several months before, and he claimed he was separated from his wife, which was untrue. A photo of Snovelle is posted with this case summary. Authorities thought he might know her whereabouts and sought him for questioning.

On May 9, when the police approached him in Coffey County, Kansas, he took his own life by shooting himself. He had no known history of violence, but about a month before he died he indicated to his brother that something bad was going to happen. Investigators believe he was involved in her case, but they don't think he took her to Kansas. She may be somewhere between Coffey County and Carroll.

Allen's adult son died suddenly in September 2010, eight months before her disappearance. She has one surviving son and four grandchildren. Authorities stated she has no history of mental illness and wasn't having any problems in her life that would have led her to walk away.

Crystal Ann Arensdorf,"July 4, 2001","Dubuque, Iowa",20,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",115 lbs,"Arensdorf was last seen at approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 4, 2001 in Dubuque, Iowa. She was at Knickers Saloon (occasionally called Knickers Tavern) in the 2100 block of Central Avenue at the time of her disappearance. She has never been heard from again.

Officials announced that Steven and David Peacock were at the bar on July 4. The brothers resided in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin at the time. They were questioned about Arensdrof several times and agreed to polygraph exams in April 2002. Authorities also searched one of the Peacocks' vehicles. The brothers have never been charged in connection to Arensdorf's case.

Robert F. Mootz was employed as a bartender at Knickers Saloon in 2001. He pleaded guilty to serving alcohol to a minor in May 2002. (Arensdorf was underage at the time of her visit to the bar). Mootz told authorities that he and Arensdorf planned to share a cab to East Dubuque, Illinois after her friends departed from the bar. The plans apparently changed during the evening and Arensdorf did not leave with Mootz. He has not been charged in connection with her disappearance.

Arensdorf's family members said that it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Authorities searched Leisure Lake in Jackson County, Iowa after a witness reported seeing a body floating in the water on July 16, 12 days after Arensdorf vanished. The sighting turned out to be a false alarm and no evidence was discovered at the scene.

Investigators eliminated Arensdorf's boyfriend as a possible suspect in her disappearance in October 2001, three months after she was reported missing. Authorities said that they do not believe she left of her own accord. Arensdorf's case remains unsolved.","https://iowacoldcases.org/case-summaries/crystal-arensdorf/

Marilyn E. Brinson,"July 17, 2002","Kansas City, Missouri",47,Black/African American,"5'4""",185 lbs,"Marilyn E Brinson's husband of thirty years, John L. Brinson, said he last saw her on the night of July 16, 2002 at their home in the 2000 block of northeast Russell Road Northland, Kansas. She went to bed as usual. When he woke up the next morning she was gone, and he assumed she went to work, but Marilyn's wedding ring was left behind on the dresser and then her boss called to ask why she had not arrived.

Police located Marilyn's car, a green four-door 1995 Ford Taurus, in the middle of 24th Street near Topping Avenue. It had been burned and a large amount of her blood was found inside the vehicle, spattered around and in pools on the dashboard and the passenger seat and floorboards. More of Marilyn's blood was found in the parking lot of her apartment complex. There was so much blood that she could not have survived.

On August 14, less than a month after Marilyn's disappearance, John was charged with her murder. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. Police found his handprint in Marilyn's blood in the trunk of her car. They believe he injured her, possibly by shooting her, and she bled to death. He may have then disposed of her body in or near the Missouri River.

The couple's adult sons said Marilyn and John were arguing the night before her disappearance, and John himself stated that shortly before his wife went missing, he had learned that she was having an affair. He maintains his innocence in her case. He was tried in June 2005, but in the middle of the proceedings the judge declared a mistrial.

Her daughter said Cupido was behaving normally that morning and promised to pick her up after school was over.

Cupido never picked her daughter up as scheduled and has never been heard from again. Her silver two-door 2001 Kia Sportage was later found abandoned behind the Apostolic Church on Highway 72 East in Iuka. Photographs of the vehicle are posted with this case summary.

Cupido's family believes she met with foul play, as it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. She was having an extramarital affair at the time of her disappearance; both her husband and her lover took lie detector tests and passed. Her case remains unsolved; the circumstances surrounding her disappearance are unknown.

Some agencies state that Cupido was last seen at the Wooden Nickel Restaurant in Cherokee, Alabama. She is originally from Canada and still has relatives living in that country.

Atterbury and McNear were originally from Springfield, Illinois, and moved to Colorado in May 1981. Neither of them contacted their families in Illinois after the move; they were never heard from again.

Investigators believe they were shot to death in an argument with two men from Springfield. Police got tips that their bodies were placed in 55-gallon drums and buried on property owned by one of the suspects in the Rocky Mountain foothills, half a mile south of South Platte, Colorado.

She was on a hiking trip with a visiting friend at the time; they were going to Bear Creek Overlook in the Bitterroot Mountains. Her friend stated he stopped to look at a scenic view between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Bolick was 20 or 30 feet away from him at the time. When he turned around about a minute later, she was gone.

She was carrying a black day pack at the time of her disappearance; it contained a .357 Magnum pistol. She is an experienced hiker and very familiar with the area.

Authorities announced they were seeking two other hikers as possible witnesses in Bolick's disappearance. Two men in their early twenties, accompanied by a black mixed-breed dog with floppy ears and white markings, were seen hiking in the area around the time she went missing. One of them is described as dark-skinned with black hair, and the other had a medium complexion and reddish hair. A sketch of the dark-haired male is posted with this case summary.

Both men were clean-cut, and they each had an athletic build. They may have been driving a light-colored, older model Chevrolet S-10 SUV with Missoula County, Montana license plates. It should be emphasized that neither of the men is considered a suspect in Bolick's case, but investigators believe they could provide valuable information.

An extensive search of the area turned up no sign of Bolick. The friend who accompanied her on the hike cooperated with investigators and is not being called a suspect in her case. She is not believed to have left of her own accord, because she left behind all of her belongings, including her pet dog and cat, billfold, identification and passport.

Bolick's husband stated she was afraid of heights and would not have gone near the edge of a precipice, or left the trail. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/barbara-assunta-bolick,-113.9389673,45.8076982

Kelsey Emily Collins,"May 9, 2009","Everett, Washington",18,African American / Black ; Caucasian / White ; Native American,"5'5"" - 5'7""
",155 lbs - 165 lbs,"Collins was last seen at 5:30 p.m. on May 9, 2009, when she left her home on 100th Street Everett, Washington to meet her boyfriend in Seattle, Washington. She planned to travel by public transportation, either the Sound Transit #510 or Metro #101/358. She never arrived in Everett and has never been heard from again.

At the time of her disappearance, Collins was carrying only a small black purse, her phone, her mp3 player, her hairbrush, her identification and a few dollars in cash. Her cellular phone has been turned off since about 8:00 p.m. the day she went missing.

Collins's parents divorced when she was three years old, and her stepfather was violent and abused her, her mother and three siblings. When she was seven, her mother took left the state with her and the other children and changed their names to get away from her stepfather. He is now serving a twenty-year prison sentence.

Collins's mother said her daughter began having problems when she reached puberty. She started running away from home when she was twelve years old, was truant from school, became sexually active, drank alcohol, and used and sold drugs.

She eventually she got involved in prostitution after she started dating an older man who turned out to be a pimp. She walked the streets in Seattle and in Portland, Oregon, and worked under several pimps. Her mother saw bruises on her and believed her pimps beat her, but Collins denied this. She was arrested for prostitution the first time at the age of sixteen.

In 2008, Collins agreed to testify against her pimp, Donnico Tyrel Johnson, and the man was charged with interstate sex trafficking of a minor, as was a woman, Lisa Miles.

She continued to work as a prostitute, however, and was arrested again in April 2009, just days before she was summoned to testify against her pimp before a federal grand jury. She disappeared a few weeks later.

Because Collins was unavailable to testify, the case against Johnson and Miles was dismissed for lack of evidence in March 2010. Three months later, Johnson pleaded guilty to trafficking of a minor in another case involving a fourteen-year-old, and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Miles was also charged in that case; she took a plea deal and was sentenced to probation.

Collins's family believes her disappearance is connected with her court testimony and she was placed in danger after she agreed to cooperate with the police investigation against Johnson. Although she was reportedly terrified, she had not been offered witness protection services. Johnson hasn't faced any charges in connection with her disappearance.

In spite of her lifestyle, it's uncharacteristic of Collins to be out of touch with her family, and she hadn't mentioned any plans to leave. She was a student at Mariner High School in 2009, where she was in special education classes due to a learning disability. She could read at a fifth-grade level and had third-grade level math skills.

Bonita Mara BickwitÊ Ê*,"July 27, 1973","Narrowsburg, New York",15,White/Caucasian,"4' 11""",90 lbs,"Bonita was working as a mother's helper at Camp Wel-Met in Narrowsburg, New York when she vanished on July 27, 1973 with her boyfriend of over a year, Mitchel Weiser. Bonita and Mitchel planned to hitchhike to attend a concert festival featuring The Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead in Watkins Glen, New York. The concert is believed to have been the largest in history, with over 800,000 people showing up.

Mitchel met Bonita at Camp Wel-Met and they set off for the concert, which was 75 miles from Narrowsburg. It is believed that Mitchel and Bonita had approximately $25 between them. They carried backpacks, sleeping bags, and a cardboard sign that read ""Watkins Glen."" They were last seen hitchhiking along State Route 97. The truck driver who gave them a ride is the last confirmed person to have seen them. It's unclear whether they actually arrived in Watkins Glen. They have never been heard from again.

Authorities initially believed that the couple simply ran off together. Bonita and Mitchel had secretly exchanged wedding rings earlier in the summer of 1973. Both were intelligent teenagers who attended John Dewey High School, a Brooklyn alternative school for gifted, high-achieving students. Bonita lived in Borough Park with her family when she was not working at Camp Wel-Met; Mitchel lived in Midwood. Both Bonita and Mitchel are from stable, middle-class Jewish families.

Both Mitchel and Bonita's loved ones say the two seemed ill at ease before they left for the concert. Bonita sneaked away from Camp Wel-Met and went home one day the week before she vanished, and took $80 which she had been saving for a bicycle. Her family was not home at the time, but neighbors saw her.

Bonita was also having difficulties with the family she was working for. She asked them for the night off when Mitchel showed up on July 27, and quit in anger when they refused. She told her employers that she would come by after the concert to collect her clothes and paycheck. She was very worried about her father, who was ill and disabled; her friends at Camp Wel-Met said she cried at night when she talked about her father. Mitchel, meanwhile, was disappointed because he could not attend the college of his choice.

Despite this, however, their loved ones believe Bonita and Mitchel were just having normal adolescent problems and would have never run away from home. Bonita's best friend was in Europe the summer she vanished, but she exchanged letters with Bonita and says their communications were normal. Mitchel was looking forward to taking his drivers' test, which was scheduled for a few weeks after he disappeared.

Bonita and Mitchel's families and friends have never forgotten about the two. Mitchel's family has kept a phone listing in the Brooklyn telephone directory since 1973 in case either of the teens decide to contact them. Years following their disappearances, Mitchel's father accepted a collect call from someone identifying herself as ""Bonnie."" By the time the operator was able to connect them, the caller had hung up. She did not call back and has never been identified.

In 2000, a witness, Allyn Smith, claimed he saw both Bonita and Mitchel drown while they were on their way back from Watkins Glen. Smith, then 24, said he was also going to the Watkins Glen rock festival and hitched a ride on a Volkswagen bus and two teenagers, whom he identified as Bonita and Mitchel, were also on the bus. He did not know their names but had heard them talking about the girl's summer camp and recalled their clothing.

They all stopped to cool off in a nearby river when Bonita got into trouble in the water. Mitchel jumped in to save her and they were both swept away, still alive. The bus driver told Smith he would call the police at the nearest gas station, but authorities have no record of such a call being made.

Police call Smith ""credible"" but wonder why, as an athletic Navy veteran, he did not try to rescue the drowning teenagers. They are investigating his account, which has not been confirmed. The driver of the bus has not been found and Smith cannot remember the location of the river the teens allegedly drowned in. As a result, his story cannot be fully investigated.

Bonita and Mitchel remain missing and their cases are unsolved. Their families have criticized the police for what they call a perfunctory investigation. The original case files have apparently been lost. Included in the files were the only existing copies of Bonita's and Mitchel's dental records, which could have been used to identify their bodies. Authorities now admit that they made many mistakes in the investigation.

A new investigator has been assigned to the cases. The state attorney general got involved in the investigation in 2000. Bonita and Mitchel's families hope the additional assistance will help solve the case.

She had allegedly stolen money from the Time Saver gas station where she worked, and the same week she disappeared a warrant was issued for her arrest. About a month after her disappearance, Alexander's Ford Escort was found north of Red Cloud, Nebraska. It was in the middle of a field, concealed by trees, and had been there for at least a couple of weeks. Inside the vehicle was a money bag containing uncashed checks but no cash, as well as some beer cans.

Although Alexander had problems in her life, including problems with alcohol and gambling, her family never believed she left of her own accord. She left behind all her belongings, including a pillow she refused to sleep without. She also left behind four children. Alexander has a history of dropping out of sight for days at a time, but her loved ones don't believe she would have left of her own accord for an extended period. Her family believes her husband may have been involved in her disappearance, but police stated he cooperated with the investigation and passed a polygraph. He is now deceased, as is Alexander's father, who was a former police officer. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/2326

Camden Anne Sylvia,"November 7, 1997","Manhattan, NY",36,White,"5'4""-5'7""",125 lbs,"Camden Sylvia and her boyfriend Michael Sullivan were last seen jogging during the evening hours of November 7, 1997 in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Sylvia and Sullivan were in the vicinity of Pearl Street and Hanover Square at the time of their disappearances. Neither of them have been heard from again.

A relative who entered their apartment days later found their wallets, passports, and a rented movie (Addicted to Love), evidence the couple hadn't planned to go anywhere. 
The couple had been having problems with their landlord, who owned their apartment building at 76 Pearl Street in Manhattan. Authorities believe that the landlord was having financial problems and wanted to increase the rent for all of his tenants in his property in late 1997. He apparently threatened to turn off the heat if the renters did not agree to an increase. Sylvia presented the landlord with a petition signed by tenants at 76 Pearl Street on the day of their disappearances. The petition stated that the tenants would withhold their payments if the landlord followed through with his threat.

The landlord was a co-defendant with David King in a $13 million civil suit charging that they had conspired to loot software, business records and customers from a fire alarm company. King disappeared during the lawsuit in 1991.

Sharon Lee Gallegos,21-Jul-60,"Alamogordo, New Mexico, USA",4,Caucasian,,,"Sharon was abducted as she was in an alley behind her home in the 500 block of Virginia Avenue in Alamogordo, New Mexico just before 3:00 p.m. on July 21, 1960.

Two children who were with her, stated a man and a woman drove up in a ""dirty old green car"", possibly a dark green 1951 or 1952 Dodge or Plymouth. They offered to buy Sharon candy and clothing if she would get in the car with them. When she refused, they dragged her into the vehicle and fled, turning west onto Fifth Street and disappearing.

The abduction was reported immediately and within about an hour police set up roadblocks to try and catch the green car at the Texas/New Mexico state border, but their efforts were fruitless. Sharon has never been heard from again.

The male abductor is described as a fair and thin Caucasian man with a long nose and straight sandy-colored hair. The female is described as short and overweight with dirty blonde hair and eyeglasses; she was in her thirties. Witnesses reported that a woman matching the description of Sharon's female abductor had been seen in the neighborhood, asking questions about Sharon, her mother and their home.

Authorities believe the couple had been stalking Sharon for at least a week prior to her abduction. They had been seen after church the Sunday prior to her disappearance, accompanied by two young children, a boy with freckles and a girl. The woman knocked on a neighbor's door to ask about Sharon's mother, Lupe Gallegos. She inquired where Lupe lived and what her financial situation was, and whether she had a little girl and whether she had a lot of children. The woman said she wanted to offer Lupe a job.

It's possible that the strange couple had tried to abduct Sharon before her disappearance on July 21. Sharon's mother stated Sharon suddenly stopped wanting to go to the grocery store around the corner; previously, she had enjoyed doing this. She also got upset when she saw a green car, and asked to be picked up and carried past it.

At the time of her disappearance, Sharon lived with her mother, her grandmother, her aunt and uncle, and six siblings and cousins. Her father, a soldier, had left the family when she was a baby and she had no contact with him. The family was not rich; Lupe supported them by working as a motel maid. They had no telephone at the home and no one ever contacted them with a ransom demand.

Sharon's abductors have never been identified and her case remains unsolved.

Kianna Galvin,06-May-16,"South Elgin, Illinois, USA",17,Biracial (African American / Caucasian),5'4-5'6,125 - 150 lbs,"Kianna has a tattoo of a heart, a pulse line and a cross on her left wrist.

Kianna was last seen in South Elgin, Illinois on May 6, 2016. At 12:30 p.m., she told a family member she was going to walk to Jim Hansen Park and would return in a few hours. She never returned and has never been heard from again.

Although many agencies classify Kianna as a runaway, investigators don't believe she left of her own accord. She had never run away from home before, and none of her friends or family members have heard from her since she disappeared. She also left behind her wallet, purse and cell phone charger, and she has no car, bank account or credit cards. Her cellular phone hasn't been used since 2:00 p.m. the day she went missing.

Kianna had been on juvenile probation prior to her disappearance, and her probationary period had recently ended. She had attended South Elgin High School and then Auburn High School in Rockford, Illinois, and was working on getting a GED. She was thinking of attending an art and design school in Atlanta, Georgia.

She wasn't dating anyone at the time of her disappearance; she'd recently broken up with her ex-boyfriend, but he's been ruled out as a suspect in her case. The day before her disappearance, Kianna was fired from her job, but she seemed to be cheerful when she was last seen.

Authorities stated that instead of going to the park on the day she disappeared, Kianna went to visit a man who lived in the basement of a residence on Revere Road. She had arranged to meet the man to get some marijuana.

The man was questioned by police and said she never went inside his house and that she had left at 12:45 p.m. while texting another man, but Kianna's cellular phone records show there were no texts sent between 12:35 p.m., when she texted the Revere Road man to say she was on her way to his house, and 1:10 p.m., when her phone was disconnected from the cellular network. Authorities believe its battery was removed or the phone completely destroyed.

The man's next-door neighbor contradicted his statement, saying he saw Kianna go inside his house. The same neighbor found blood on his garbage can lid on May 12, six days after Kianna's disappearance. The blood was later confirmed to be Kianna's.

The man Kianna visited on the day of her disappearance was later convicted of assaulting a woman and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. He has not been named as a suspect in her disappearance, but he is a person of interest, and police searched his residence in November 2016. What, if anything, was recovered has not been released to the public.

Foul play is suspected in Kianna's disappearance; authorities believe she was murdered shortly after she disappeared. Her disappearance remains unsolved.

Sandra Mason Gann,04-Jan-04,"Starke, Florida",48,Caucasian,5'8-5'10,140 lba,"Sandra's maiden name is Alderman; some agencies refer to her Sandra Alderman Gann. Her nickname is Sandy. She has a small homemade tattoo of a butterfly below her chest, and a small homemade tattoo of a cross between her right thumb and forefinger.

Sandra was last seen at approximately 5:00 a.m. at her residence in the vicinity of the 20000 block of northwest 77th Place, four and a half miles west of Starke, Florida.

Her husband of six months, Dwayne Edward Gann, claims she got a ride to work with an unknown individual, but Sandra's daughter says this is uncharacteristic of her, as she owned her own vehicle and normally drove herself to work.

Sandra's purse, keys, and driver's license were found on top of her light blue Chevrolet truck, which was parked outside her residence. Her daughter reported her missing on January 6, two days after she was last seen.

Later on the day Sandra disappeared, the mobile home she shared with Dwayne caught fire and burned to the ground. It is unknown if the fire is related to her disappearance, but it is considered suspicious and possibly set deliberately.

An extensive search of the area has failed to turn up any sign of Sandra. Her daughter says it is extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without telling anyone. Police are calling her disappearance suspicious.

Dwayne and his sister, Deborah Sue Starling, are both considered persons of interest in Sandra's disappearance. They were the last two people to see her. Starling lived next door to Sandra and Dwayne and her home was searched for possible evidence in Sandra's case; it is unknown what, if anything, was discovered.

There was a domestic violence incident between Sandra and Dwayne in May 2003; he was charged with aggravated battery after Sandra claimed he pushed her and shut a door on her legs. The charges were later dropped and Sandra and Dwayne were married at about the same time.

Dwayne maintains his innocence in his wife's disappearance and maintains that she was involved in drugs and this could be a factor in her disappearance. He has a prison record dating back to 1978 and is currently incarcerated on charges unrelated to Sandra's case. Photos of Dwayne and his sister are posted with this case summary.

Sandra's case is unsolved. She was employed at a construction job at the time of her disappearance. Foul play is suspected in her case.

Stephanie Marie Gant-Brady,08-Apr-84,"Baltimore, Maryland, USA",39,Black / African American,5'3,110 lbs,"Gant-Brady was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1978 and has difficulty walking as a result of her condition. She utilizes a cane and a wheelchair to get around, but she had neither with her when she vanished. Gant-Brady wears eyeglasses or contact lenses. Her nickname is Penny.

Gant-Brady was last seen in Baltimore, Maryland on April 8, 1984. She resided in the 4600 block of Horizon Circle in the Woodlawn area at the time.

After her disappearance, Gant-Brady's male companion stated she had traveled to London, England to write a book. However, she never obtained a passport, did not pick up her last paycheck, and left all of her personal belongings, including her cane and wheelchair, behind when she vanished.

Gant-Brady has one son. She has a bachelor's degree in sociology from Morgan State University and was attempting a master's degree from the University of Baltimore in 1984. She was the first African-American woman to reach the rank of lieutenant in the Maryland National Guard, and she was also a member of the Governor's Committee for the Handicapped.

Gant-Brady was employed as a substitute middle and elementary school teacher at the time of her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.

Tisa Dianna Gantt,02-Jan-07,"Titusville, Florida, USA",36,Black / African American,5'6-5'8,140-155 lbs,"Gantt was last seen in Titusville, Florida on January 2, 2007. She has never been heard from again. She had been allegedly raped near south Deleon Avenue and filed a sexual assault charge against Edwin Deon Morris just prior to her disappearance. She was afraid Morris would retaliate against her for telling the police about the attack.

A year after she went missing, police searched Morris's property for Gantt's remains. The search yielded no evidence. Morris is currently in prison on unrelated charges, and he remains a person of interest in Gantt's disappearance.

Investigators initially believed Gantt had left of her own accord, but now they think she may have been taken against her will. Her purse was found in a ditch near W.C. Stafford Street in January 2010, over three years after her disappearance. The purse, which contained her belongings, had been there so long that weeds had grown through it. A search of the area turned up no other evidence.

Gantt left behind twelve siblings. She graduated from Titusville High School and Brevard Community College, where she won a Campus Activities Award. Her case remains unsolved.

Lyrian Wyvonne Barry-Stallings,"July 1, 1960","Columbus, MS 39702",23,Black/African American,"5'0""",150 lbs,"Lyrian graduated from R.E. Hunt High School in 1956 and moved to New Orleans, Louisiana with Eulice ""Eddie"" Stallings. She eventually returned home to Columbus, Mississippi with a baby girl. Eddie followed her there and they picked up their relationship, but it was troubled: Eddie was controlling and he was involved with drugs.

It's unclear whether they were legally married, and Eddie began seeing other women and then married one who said she was pregnant with his child. Lyrian was seeing Sonny Lucas, a distant relative. In the summer of 1960, Lyrian decided to move to St. Louis, stay with her aunt, find a job and make a new life for herself and her daughter.

She left her baby, then eight months old, behind with her sister. Lyrian planned to return in August when her pregnant sister's baby was born, and then she and her sister would go to St. Louis together. However, she never returned to Columbus.

Lyrian's aunt stated that after she arrived in St. Louis, she stayed with her briefly, then went to either Needham, Massachusetts or Bridgeport, Connecticut to start a job as a live-in maid. Lyrian's aunt said Sonny Lucas had also moved to St. Louis, and he and Lyrian got into a ""knock-down, drag-out fight"" the night she left.

Lyrian never contacted her family again. Although they grew increasingly concerned as time passed without her calling or writing them, they didn't file a missing persons report. There's no evidence that anyone ever used her Social Security number, and her family now believes she's deceased.

Her daughter and her parents are now deceased, as is one brother, but she still has six siblings who are interested in learning her fate, and eventually a missing persons report was filed. Columbus police are investigating Lyrian's disappearance.

Inez Garcia,02-Nov-52,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",26,Hispanic,,,"Inez was last seen in her hometown of Santa Fe, New Mexico on November 2, 1952. There are different accounts as to the circumstances of her disappearance.

One story was that Inez and her husband were at a bar on Water Street when they got into an argument, and she jumped out of their vehicle and walked away.

Another account has it that Inez last saw her husband at lunch, then went out with friends for the evening and visited two bars. She supposedly became extremely drunk and refused to join her friends when they left the establishment at 11:00 p.m. Instead she left with a stranger at 1:00 a.m. and never returned. She has never been heard from again.

Inez's husband, Juan Andres Jose Garcia, has long the prime suspect in Inez's disappearance. He died in the 1990. In 2014, charred bone fragments were found buried under the dirt floor of the Garcia family's garage at their former home in the 500 block of Onate Place.

While he was alive, Juan never permitted anyone to go into the garage. Authorities have sent the bones for testing to determine whether they're human. Bones found in the garage in 1996 had turned out to be from animals.

Inez's loved ones don't believe she would have abandoned her children. Foul play is suspected in her case; it remains unsolved.

Regina Marie Garcia,16-Oct-08,"Sacramento, California, USA",33,Hispanic,5'4,130 lbs,"Garcia was last seen in Sacramento, California on October 16, 2008. Her live-in boyfriend, Randy Macedo, said she rode her bicycle away from their home on Stewart Road and never returned. She left behind her Social Security card, Medi-Cal card and health insurance card. Macedo reported her missing on October 30.

Garcia has six children; Macedo is the father of the youngest. She lost custody of the other five due to her drug use, and her sister was caring for them. Garcia has a history of heroin abuse. She was in a methadone program at the time of her disappearance.

She had dropped out of sight in the past, but had always returned home after a short time period. Following her October 2008 disappearance, she was never heard from again.

In 2012, authorities searched Macedo's home in response to an unrelated incident and found various illegal weapons, and he was arrested. His arrest revived the investigation into Garcia's disappearance, and investigators realized there were inconsistencies in his account of what happened. Seven weeks later they returned to the home to search for evidence in Garcia's case, including her body.

Macedo has a history of violent behavior, and in the 1990s he was sentenced to four years in prison for violating a restraining order and making threats towards his ex-wife. His relationship with Garcia was troubled, and he's considered the prime suspect in her disappearance. However, he has never faced charges in connection with it and maintains his innocence.

Although Garcia was originally considered to be missing voluntarily, foul play is now suspected in her disappearance. Since she went missing she hasn't had any contact with social service agencies or law enforcement, which is uncharacteristic of her. Her case remains unsolved.

Tracey Leigh Gardner-Tetso,06-Mar-05,"Rosedale, Maryland, USA",32,Caucasian,5'4,130 lbs,"Tracey was last seen at approximately 3:00 p.m. on March 6, 2005 at her residence in the vicinity of the 7000 block of Bluegrass Road in Rosedale, Maryland. She was planning to meet friends that evening to attend a Motley Crue music concert at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C.; her friends had bought her a concert ticket for her birthday.

Tracey never arrived at the concert and has never been heard from again. Her cellular phone has been turned off since her disappearance; the last recorded call was at 3:05 p.m. on March 6.

There is a record of her black 1996 Pontiac Trans Am passing through the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel southbound at 7:48 p.m. The vehicle was located on March 17, eleven days later, in the parking lot of a Days Inn in the vicinity of the 6600 block of Richie Highway in Glen Burnie, Maryland. It has tinted windows and the Maryland license plate number LRN 534. A surveillance camera of the parking lot showed an unidentified figure driving the vehicle into the lot, parking it, getting out and walking away. Enhancement of the video indicated the figure was a man.

Motley Crue posted a reward for information leading to Tracey's safe return, but the offer yielded no viable tips.

Tracey was reported afraid of her husband, Dennis Joseph Tetso, at the time of her disappearance and was contemplating divorce. They had only been married for about six months. She had begun a relationship with a coworker in January 2005, and was planning to attend the concert with him.

Dennis was the one who reported her disappearance to police, but afterward he refused to cooperate with the investigation or participate in search efforts.

In June 2009, over four years after Tracey's disappearance, Dennis was arrested and charged with her murder. At his trial in October 2010, the prosecution alleged he was an abusive husband who killed Tracey after he found out she was having an affair.

Dennis was the only defense witness; he stated he had not harmed his wife and had no idea where he was. He was convicted of second-degree murder.

Tracey was employed as a dispatcher at Aggregate Industries at the time of her disappearance. She is described as a responsible and caring woman who owned a home and cars, had a good job and took good care of her three pets.

Her loved ones stated it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning; they never believed she left of her own accord. Her body has never been recovered, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.

 She has a black ink tattoo of a bird on her right ankle and a tattoo of a large bird on her lower middle back. She had blonde hair at the time of her disappearance.

Michaela Joy Garecht,19-Nov-88,"Hayward, California, USA",9,Caucasian,4'8,75 lbs,"Michaela and a friend rode their scooters to the Rainbow Market on Mission Boulevard in Hayward, California on November 19, 1988. The store was two blocks from her home.

Michaela noticed that her friend's scooter had been moved in the parking lot when the girls exited the store; when she went to retrieve it, an unidentified Caucasian male grabbed her and forced her into his vehicle. Michaela's friend went inside the Rainbow Market for assistance, but the abductor was able to escape with Michaela. Neither has been seen again.

The abductor is described as between 18 to 24 years old in 1988, with a pockmarked or pimpled face. He wore a white t-shirt and had longish dirty blonde hair and a slender build. Two sketches of Michaela's abductor are posted with this case summary; the original sketch was later revised.

The abductor drove a large older model American-made sedan. It was possibly a four-door vehicle and was cream, gold, or tan in color. The car may have had cement splatters on the sides and lights set into the rear bumper. The front bumper was battered; the vehicle may have previously been in an accident. It appeared to be run-down. The car was last seen speeding south on Mission Boulevard towards nearby Union City, California with Michaela inside.

Multiple people are considered suspects in this case. Their information and photographs can be found in the link below.

Diamond Daisy Bobbie Monet Bynum,"July 25, 2015","Gary, IN",21,Black/African American,"4'8""",238 lbs,"Bynum and her nephew, King Walker, disappeared from Gary, Indiana on July 25, 2015. Bynum lived with her father and stepmother; King lived with his mother and visited his grandparents and aunt every weekend.

They were last seen at Bynum's home in the 500 block of Matthews Street at approximately 10:20 a.m., when Bynum's stepmother took a nap. When she woke up at 11:00 a.m., her daughter and grandson were gone. It's believed they walked away from the residence, possibly to go to a local store.

Bynum's family had moved to Gary from Hammond, Indiana in February 2015 and Bynum was still unfamiliar with the area; it's possible she and King became lost. Her family stated it's uncharacteristic of her to go more than a few blocks from home.

There were reported sightings of the pair in Gary, Hammond and Chicago after their disappearances, but none have been confirmed. Their family hopes they're still alive. Their cases remain unsolved.

 Bynum has Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic condition with symptoms including mental disability, short stature, and a constant feeling of hunger. Bynum has the mental capacity of a five- to seven-year-old and it's difficult for her to communicate with others. Her family understands her, however, and she knows her father's phone number. She needs medication which she doesn't have with her; when she doesn't take it she develops behavior problems and may become a danger to herself.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/57949.

Catherine Blanch Romer,"April 8, 1980","Brunswick, GA",77,White,"5'5""",145 lbs,"Catherine Romer and her husband Charles Romer disappeared shortly after checking into the Holiday Inn located along I-95 and U.S. 341 in Brunswick, Georgia. The couple was traveling from their winter home in Miami, Florida to their home in Scarsdale, New York; in their custom black 2-door 1978 Lincoln Continental with New York license plate ""CRR-CBR."" The car has never been located.

The couple checked into the hotel on Tuesday, April 8, 1980 at 3:51 p.m. They took their belongings to their room. Around 5 p.m. that evening an officer with the Georgia Highway Patrol recalled seeing the couple's car south of Brunswick parked near a group of restaurants. On Friday, April 11th, hotel management notified police that the couple's room had not appeared occupied since they had initially checked in. While searching the room, investigators noted that the last complete entry of Charles' diary was April 7th and that it indicated that the couple planned to be back in New York on April 10th. Mr. Romer was described as ""extremely meticulous and unlikely to have deviated from his plan.""

A massive search was conducted of back roads and swamps. Helicopters and divers were used but no clues as to the whereabouts of the couple or their car was ever found. Investigators checked restaurants and service stations along 120 miles of interstate between the Florida state line and Savannah. Charles' sons hired a private investigator to facilitate the search. Two theories were formed. One was that the couple was victims of robbery and foul play. The other was that they ran off the road into the swamp, which is quick sand in some areas.

Some men fishing near Jekyll Island reported seeing a couple matching the Romers' description. Investigators doubt that it was the Romers due to the timeframe of the sighting.

Charles Romer's sons made annual trips to Georgia to keep the case active. A diver from the initial search continues to search for the Romers and their car. Catherine was declared legally dead in 1985.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/73872

Kaitlyn Marie Blom,"December 7, 2016","Port Alsowrth, AK",14,White,"5'5""",105 lbs,"Kaitlyn was last seen in Port Alsworth, Alaska on December 7, 2016. She was on a single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane piloted by Kyle Longerbeam, with her father, Scott, and brother, Zachary. They were on their way to Anchorage, Alaska, where the children's school, Tanalian School, was competing in the Mixed Six Volleyball State Championship.

The Bloms had been scheduled to take a scheduled air carrier flight to the city, but that morning, Scott, Kaitlyn and Zachary canceled their reservations and decided to fly with Longerbeam. Scott's wife took the commercial flight because Longerbeam's plane only had seats for four. The Bloms' middle son, who played on the volleyball team, flew to Anchorage on a different flight, and their oldest son was already in Anchorage attending the University of Alaska.

The flight should have taken ninety minutes. The plane took off from Port Alsworth that morning, and never arrived in Anchorage as expected. Authorities believe it went down in Lake Clark, but no bodies have been recovered. The next day, the plane's co-pilot seat, three of its wheels, and some of the occupants' personal belongings were found floating in the lake. Nothing else has been recovered.

Longerbeam didn't yet have enough training for instrument rating and had to fly under visual flight years, meaning that in uncontrolled airspace, he needed at least one mile of visibility. When he took off from Port Alsworth that day, the weather was good enough to operate under visual flight rules, but there was reduced visibility along the anticipated route, including low-lying freezing fog over Lake Clark.

Poor visibility may have played a role in the cause of the crash, but the National Transportation Safety Board's report ruled the cause of the crash ""undetermined due to a lack of physical evidence.""

The Bloms and Longerbeam are presumed deceased, but will remain classified as missing under their bodies are located. Due to the depth of the lake, a successful recovery mission is considered unlikely.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/38485?nav

Cefarelli told her she would not come home because she knew that she wasn't supposed to be there when she was using drugs. Her fiance's mother told her to come home immediately, but she didn't come home. She has never been heard from again.

She was driving a black 2007 Hummer HU3 with the Florida license plate number AWGM26. A security camera filmed her arriving at the condo and then driving away.

At 4:26 p.m. that day, Parker's brother sent her a text message asking where she was. The reply read simply ""Waterford."" Waterford Lakes is a neighborhood in Orlando. Her brother said she normally sent long text messages and it was uncharacteristic of her to reply with just one word; he doesn't believe Parker sent the message herself. At 6:50 p.m., Parker's eleven-year-old son from another relationship called her sister, concerned because his mother hadn't arrived home. She didn't show up for her 7:30 p.m. shift as a bartender, and has never been heard from again.

Her cellular phone pinged in the area of Oakridge Road near Belle Isle, more than seven miles where she was last seen, at 8:00 p.m. The phone turned off there. The next day, her vehicle was located at Walden Palms Apartments in the 4700 block of Walden Circle in Orlando, with its decals removed from the windows. Three weeks after Parker's disappearance, police found her cellular phone in a lake near the Nela Bridge in Belle Isle.

Parker and Smith had taped an episode of the television show The People's Court in June 2011. They were in a dispute over a $5,000 engagement ring. Parker threw the ring at him during an argument at a hotel and it fell nine stories and was lost in the hotel atrium. During the taping she said her relationship with Smith had been troubled and he could become vindictive and abusive, particularly after he had been drinking. The judge ordered Parker and Smith to split the cost of the ring. Parker disappeared on the same day the episode aired.

Parker's family describes her as a dedicated mother who held three jobs to support her children: in addition to bartending, she was a hairdresser and had a home tanning business. They don't believe she would have left of her own accord and abandoned her children. Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/13054?nav

Beverly Deane Brehm,"November 28, 2008","Dayton, NV",74,White,"5'2""",130-140 lbs,"Beverly lived with her ex-husband, James MacTavish, and her brother, Gordon Douglas Brehm in Dayton, Nevada; Gordon had moved in with them in 2006. Beverly and Gordon were last seen on November 12, 2008.

According to loved ones, Beverly had been estranged from her children for decades, and after she quit her job she became reclusive. This is part of the reason no one realized she and Gordon were missing until January 2013, when MacTavish died by suicide.

When police were attempting to locate his next of kin, they realized the Brehms were last known to be living with him, and that they'd been unaccounted for since 2008. At the time of MacTavish's death, there was no indication that Beverly and Gordon were still living in the house. The Brehms were reported missing on November 14, 2013, five years after they were last seen.

Photos of Gordon are unavailable. His date of birth is November 20, 1939, making him 68 years old at the time of his disappearance. He's described as Caucasian with sandy hair, 5'9 to 5'11 tall and 150 to 175 pounds.

The circumstances of Beverly and Gordon's disappearances are unclear.

Naturally brown hair but has been known to dye her hair reddish in color. Shoulder length or shorter.
ÊKnown to have lost middle finger fingernail in industrial accident.

Jeanette Maria Corpuz,"January 13, 2003","Reno, NV",27,White,"5'6""",160 lbs,"Jeanette was last seen at her Reno, Nevada home by a real estate agent on January 13, 2003. On January 21, she had a phone conversation with her ex-husband. She has never been heard from again.

On January 25, Jeanette's husband, Lyle Marsh Montgomery, abandoned her son in a Shopko in Salt Lake City, Utah. A photograph of Montgomery are posted with this case summary.

Jeanette's son was only three years old at the time of his abandonment and could not remember his last name or the full name of his mother, so it took several days to identify him. It was only then that authorities realized Jeanette was missing.

Montgomery fled after abandoning the child, but he was apprehended after a few days later and charged with misdemeanor child abuse. He is considered a suspect in Jeanette's disappearance.

He had been married to her for less than a month prior to her disappearance, and there have been questions as to whether or not the marriage was legal: Jeanette may not yet have been legally divorced from her previous husband when she married Montgomery. She had previously accused him of domestic abuse, in October 2002.

Jeanette's son told Salt Lake City Police that his stepfather fired a shot at his mother, but missed. Several guns, knives, and boxes of ammunition were found in their home when authorities searched it.

The bed and dresser were missing from the master bedroom. A large amount of blood was present in the bedroom, with smaller dribbles in the shower area, hallway, and entryway of the residence. Blood had soaked through the carpet and the carpet pad and stained the floor beneath. DNA tests determined that the blood was Jeanette's.

Montgomery attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol in his and Jeanette's home and was treated at a psychiatric hospital before being released on February 27. After he was released from jail, shortly before midnight on April 8, 2003, he shot himself to death. He did not leave a note.

Authorities still believe he had something to do with his wife's disappearance, but since his death the investigation has stalled.

Jeanette's son was sent to live with his biological father in California. Jeanette's case remains unsolved. She has disappeared before, but always stayed in contact with her family and returned home soon. Authorities are investigating her case as a homicide.

Cornelia Meyer,"July 26, 1996","Anvil Spring Canyon, Death Valley, CA",28,White (German),"5'5""",130 lbs,"Egbert Rimkus, his girlfriend, Cornelia Meyer, his son Georg Weber and Meyer's son Max, disappeared from Death Valley on July 22, 1996. 
The four had arrived from Germany in the US earlier in July and were going through California to Las Vegas in a minivan rented in Los Angeles. They were expected to return to Germany on July 29 but their reserved seats aboard a Transworld Airways flight remained empty. 
They were listed as missing persons by Interpol on August 14. 
On October 26, 1996 a Park Ranger on an aerial surveillance mission spotted their van stuck in a wash at Anvil Spring Canyon, a wilderness area closed to vehicular traffic. Three of its four tires were flat. Despite extensive searches in the surrounding area no trace of the tourists -but an empty beer bottle a half-mile away matching bottles in the vehicle- was found. The search was called off on October 26 but in the following years numerous other searches, organized by private parties and search-and-rescue groups took place. 
Investigators managed to retrace some of their steps. The foursome checked out of their Treasure Island hotel, in Nevada, room on July 22 and drove that same day to Death Valley. A cash-register receipt from the Furnace Creek Visitor Center's store indicates they bought an informational booklet on July 22, 1996. The following day, they drove toward the Panamint Mountains. They let an entry in a visitor's guest book in an abandoned mining camp in the national park, in German, it read: ""7-23-96. Conny Egbert Georg Max. We are going through the pass."". Rimkus was probably referring to Mengel Pass on the southwest border of Death Valley National Park.

Cecilia Bravo Cabrera,"June 9, 2016","Lemoore, CA",30,Hispanic/Latino,"5'1""",160 lbs,"Cabrera was last seen leaving the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California just before 12:39 a.m. on June 9, 2016. She was driving her dark gray 2013 Chevrolet Malibu. She has never been heard from again. Five hours later, her car was found abandoned and burned in an orchard near Traver, California, thirty miles from the casino. There was no sign of her at the scene.

In December 2017, Francisco Yanes Valdivia and Rosalina Lopez were charged in Cabrera's case. Photos of both suspects are posted with this case summary. Authorities believe Valdivia, who is from Mexico, married Cabrera, a U.S. citizen, so he could get legal residency in the United States. However, at the time of the marriage, Valdivia was already legally married to Lopez. He had married Lopez in Mexico in 2007, then married Cabrera in 2008.

Valdivia was charged with arson and murder, and Lopez was charged with being an accessory after the fact. Valdivia was already in custody on unrelated drug charges at the time he was charged with murder; when police were investigating Cabrera's case, they discovered he was operating multiple marijuana grow sites.

Cabrera had gone out with Valdivia on the night of her disappearance, which was unusual; they rarely went out anywhere together. Both he and Lopez had previously threatened her life. Since she went missing, Cabrera hasn't used any of her social media accounts; she had previously been very active on social media. Her four children haven't heard from her either.

Investigators stated there was ""significant digital and forensic evidence"" supporting their murder case. Valdivia and Lopez are awaiting trial. Cabrera's body has never been found, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/51157

Jonathan apparently left Cindy unattended for an unspecified amount of time. He discovered that his daughter was missing after he returned to the area. Cindy has never been seen again.

Cindy's disappearance was not reported to authorities until April 1, three days after she disappeared. Janine told police she did not report it sooner because she was afraid her husband would be considered a suspect, since he had a history of spousal abuse.

Jonathan was scheduled to take a polygraph exam shortly after Cindy's disappearance was reported to authorities, but he failed to arrive for his appointment. Investigators found him and Janine inside a room at the Holiday Inn in Visalia, California on April 11, 1989. Jonathan was dead and Janine was comatose.

She was leaving her daughter's residence in the 1600 block of DeYoung to go shopping at approximately 11:30 a.m. She was driving her white 1993 Ford Explorer. The Explorer was discovered abandoned in front of a Target store in the parking lot of the River Park Shopping Center, within walking distance of her home, two days afterwards. Her purse and the vehicle's keys were found inside it. The driver's seat had been adjusted for someone much taller than Sandra's height. Sandra's relatives told authorities that it is very uncharacteristic of her to leave without contacting her loved ones. There was no sign of her near the car and she has never been heard from again.

Sandra was employed as a teacher at Gibson Elementary School in Fresno in 1999. She was married to Frank Ray Kerby, who was employed by the Kerman Unified School District in California.

Authorities stated that Frank gave conflicting statements about his wife's disappearance and has refused to cooperate with the investigation since its initial stages. He claims he was in Fresno on the day Sandra disappeared, but that day a call was made from his cellular phone in Reedley, California. Investigators obtained a search warrant for the couple's residence in January 2000, six months after Sandra vanished. Authorities seized a computer, files and personal records from the home. Sandra's diary entries indicate that she knew her husband was having an affair.

Officials told Sandra's family that they reclassified her case as that of a homicide in February 2000 due to the circumstances involved in her disappearance. There have not been any arrests in connection with Sandra's case. Investigators are not calling Frank a suspect, but he has not been ruled out either. He proposed marriage to his girlfriend just days after Sandra went missing. In 2006, Frank filed to have Sandra declared legally dead. Her mother fought the petition, but it was granted in February 2006. Frank stated he had his wife declared dead so he could get the title to their home.

Sandra's case remains unsolved and she is considered to be missing under suspicious circumstances.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/25469

Kristin Denise Smart,"May 25, 1996","San Luis Obispo, CA",18,White,"5'8""",125-155 lbs,"Kristin Smart was a freshman architecture major at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California in 1996. She departed from an off-campus party and headed for her dormitory at approximately 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. on May 25, 1996. At the party, Smart was acting as if she was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs. When she left the gathering, she was having trouble walking.

Smart was accompanied by a female acquaintance and another student from the university, Paul R. Flores, when she left the party. He was a food science major at Cal Poly in 1996. Smart apparently met Flores at the party earlier in the evening. Her friend separated from Smart and Flores at the intersection of Perimeter Road and Grand Avenue on the college campus.

Flores allegedly told Smart's friend that he would see Smart to her home. She was last seen walking north on Grand Avenue with Flores, towards Muir Hall, her dormitory. Smart has never been heard from again. She was not carrying any identification, cash or personal belongings at the time she vanished.

Flores was reportedly seen with a black eye later in the day on May 25. When questioned about Smart's whereabouts by authorities, Flores claimed that he continued walking to his own dormitory and last saw Smart on Grand Avenue shortly after her other friend departed.

Smart's roommate contacted police later in the morning of May 25, worried because Smart had not returned to her dormitory. The roommate had been at the room the night Smart was last seen, and never saw her get back home. Her clothing, toiletries, cosmetics, medicine and identification were left undisturbed in her room; there is no evidence that she made it back there.

Authorities refused to take the missing persons report for four days because Smart disappeared on Memorial Day weekend and college students often take impromptu vacations at that time.

Investigators have repeatedly questioned Flores regarding Smart's case since 1996, but he has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer. They offered him a plea deal where he would plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter and reveal the location of Smart's body in exchange for a six-year prison term, but he refused the offer. Flores is the prime and only suspect in Smart's disappearance, but authorities do not have enough evidence at their disposal to charge him in the case.

Smart's case is open and unsolved. Her family held a memorial service for her in May 2001, and again in June 2003. She was declared dead in May 2002. Smart's family attempted to pursue a civil suit against Flores for Smart's wrongful death, but dropped the case in 1996 after Flores pleaded his Fifth Amendment rights during the proceedings. Smart's family has since revived the suit, which has yet to go to trial. They continue to place pressure on Flores to speak to authorities regarding any possible knowledge he may have about their daughter's disappearance.

Smart is described as friendly and generous. She is a competitive swimmer and had traveled to many places, including Hawaii and South America, prior to her disappearance. She had originally enrolled at the University of California at Santa Barbara, but transferred to Cal Poly early in her freshman year. Her case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/1984

Kristi Gwen O'Pry,"July 19, 1996","Shreveport, LA",26,White,"5'7""",115 lbs,"O'Pry needed to run errands on July 19, 1996 in her hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. Eric Dale Mickelson, a friend of her boyfriend, agreed to drive O'Pry if she paid for his gasoline costs. Mickelson and O'Pry were riding in his white 1971 Chevrolet Fleetside pickup truck.

O'Pry and Mickelson visited her sister's residence on Meriweather Road and departed at approximately 8:00 p.m. Mickelson told authorities that he and O'Pry stopped at the Circle K store on the corner of Walker Road and Mackey Lane. Mickelson stated that O'Pry used the pay phone at the store. Phone records did not show any indication of any calls O'Pry may have made from the location.

Mickelson claimed that he did not witness O'Pry make a call from the phone; he said that he was repairing his vehicle's stereo speaker wires at the time she was inside the business. Mickelson stated that he proceeded to drop O'Pry off at the El Chico entrance of the South Park Mall on Jewella Avenue in Shreveport at approximately 8:30 p.m. O'Pry has never been seen again. She was reported missing four days after she was last seen.

O'Pry's boyfriend of six years, Jerry ""Todd"" Dean, told investigators that Mickelson called him between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. on July 20, 1996, the day following O'Pry's disappearance. Dean said that Mickelson told him he dropped O'Pry at the mall the previous evening.

O'Pry lived with Dean and his friend, Wade Burnley, on Linwood Avenue at the time she was last seen. Dean did not inform O'Pry's family that she never returned home until July 23, four days after she initially disappeared. He stated he and O'Pry had a troubled relationship with frequent fights.

O'Pry did not take any personal belongings with her when she vanished. She also left behind her three-year-old daughter, something that her family said was completely uncharacteristic of her behavior. Security guards at the South Park Mall told investigators that they did not observe anyone matching O'Pry's description at the shopping center the night she was last seen. Authorities are not certain if she arrived at the location.

Both Dean and Burnley passed polygraph tests administered by law enforcement shortly after O'Pry's disappearance. Mickelson refused to take a lie detector test, saying that he considers the devices unreliable. He was considered the prime suspect in O'Pry's case, although for many years he maintained his innocence. He and his girlfriend, Susane ""Beverly"" Arthur, were charged with the unrelated murder of an elderly Shreveport man, Charles Martin, in 2007.

While in prison awaiting trial on that charge, Mickelson confessed to O'Pry's murder. He said he had strangled her and ultimately dismembered her body and threw the parts in dumpsters. Some months later, in August 2007, he was charged with second-degree murder in O'Pry's case. Authorities stated they found unspecified evidence in the pond that corroborated his confession, but her body has not been located. Mickelson was convicted of Martin's murder in August 2011 and sentenced to death, but his conviction was later overturned. At a re-trial in Martin's case, he was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison. He is still awaiting trial for O'Pry's murder.

Extensive searches have not yielded any clues as to O'Pry's whereabouts. Foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved in O'Pry's disappearance.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/726

Crystal Marie Beal,"September 10, 2018","Shreveport, LA",29,White,"5'5""",150 lbs,"Beal was last seen in Caddo Parish, Louisiana on August 6, 2018. She had been arrested in Arkansas and transported to the Caddo Correctional Center on charges of resisting an officer and illegal possession of stolen things. That night, a friend bailed her out of jail. Beal posted on her Facebook page on August 8. After that date, she was never seen or heard from again.

Another woman, Kylie Hartman, disappeared from Shreveport, Louisiana a month later, on September 10. Both she and Beal are from Shreveport, have criminal histories and ran in the same same social circles. In spite of this, police have found no evidence that the women knew each other or that their disappearances are related.

Beal's family believes she is dead. It would be uncharacteristic of her to abandon her son, or to go for this long without any contact with law enforcement. She does have active warrants out for arrest. The circumstances of her disappearance are unclear and her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/54078?nav

Arrilla Naomi Webb-Vaul,"March 15, 1979","Shreveport, Bossier Parish, LA",23,White,"5'1""",100 lbs,"Arrilla Webb-Vaul dropped her husband off at Eastgate Shopping Center in the vicinity of 70th St. in Shreveport, LA the day of her disappearance. Her tire had been slashed yet was not completely flat. She then left the shopping center and traveled about 200 yards over the bridge into Bossier Parish to head home. Witnesses saw Arrilla pull over on the side of the road just over the bridge and watched a white male in a truck pull up behind her. Arrilla has not been seen or heard from since. Her car was later located on the shoulder of the road with no sign of Arrilla's whereabouts

Authorities initially believed Webb-Vaul had left of her own accord. She was apparently severely distressed at the time of her disappearance. Just a few days before she was last seen, she wrote a letter to her mother asking to be removed from her mother's will, and saying that if anything happened to her, her car should be given to her mother rather than her husband. Webb-Vaul's mother had herself disappeared at least once and was gone for seven years before resurfacing.

Webb-Vaul's disappearance may be connected to the murder of 18-year-old Ladoisha Ann ""Dodie"" Gay, a high school student who disappeared from the Eastgate Shopping Center only a month after Webb-Vaul did. Her car was later found abandoned with a punctured, flat tire, just like Webb-Vaul's was. Gay's skeletal remains were found under a bridge in rural DeSoto Parish, Louisiana six weeks later.

Her homicide and Webb-Vaul's disappearance remain unsolved, but police do have a suspect: James Edward Wood, a former truck driver and suspected serial killer who was convicted of the 1993 murder of an 11-year-old Idaho girl. He lived in the Shreveport, Louisiana area between the 1960s and the early 1990s.

After his arrest in the Idaho case, Wood confessed to the 1976 murder of a Shreveport, Louisiana woman, but he was never charged in her death. Authorities believe he may have committed as many as 185 robberies, 85 rapes and dozens of murders over thirty years. He died of natural causes in prison in 2004.

Webb-Vaul grew up in Friendswood, Texas, and graduated high school there in 1974. She married in 1976 and moved to Louisiana after her husband, an airman, was assigned to the Barksdale Air Force Base.

Foul play is suspected in Webb-Vaul's disappearance. She was an only child, and her husband and parents are now deceased..

Yasmin Rayon Acree,"January 15, 2008","Chicago, Illinois",15,Black/African American,"5'1""",125 lbs,"Yasmin was last seen at her family's Chicago, Illinois home on January 15, 2008. That day she went to the North Lawndale YMCA, where she was involved in sports and other activities. After she came home, she did a load of laundry and went to bed. She was gone by the next morning.

There were indications of a break-in at their residence; two locks on an outside fence and a lock on the basement door had been cut. Yasmin's bedroom was in the basement. Her room appeared untouched and nothing was taken, not even Yasmin's eyeglasses.

Her family has criticized the police investigation in her case, claiming investigators assumed she was a runaway and failed to look into other possible causes of her disappearance. Authorities admitted they made serious errors at the onset of the investigation by not immediately dusting for fingerprints and not taking the broken lock from the basement door.

Yasmin was a freshman at Austin Polytech Academy at the time of her disappearance, and was about to start a new job. She has no history of runaway behavior. However, Yasmin, who was born in Kentucky, had a troubled past. Her mother, who is now deceased, was a drug addict, and Yasmin and her older brother were removed from her home when they were toddlers.

Yasmin spent several years in the Kentucky foster care system, where she was sexually abused and developed severe emotional and behavioral problems. In 2001, Yasmin and her brother went to live with Rose Mae Starnes, their aunt by marriage, and she adopted them in 2006.

Starnes stated she loved Yasmin but had trouble dealing with her behavior problems, and occasionally disciplined her by whipping her with a belt or locking her in the basement. In 2007, when Yasmin's brother was sixteen years old, Starnes asked him to leave her home. Yasmin was the only child living at the residence at the time of her disappearance. She had been an excellent student in middle school, but when she started high school she got poor grades.

Jimmie Terrell Smith and his father lived in the second-floor apartment in Yasmin's building at the time of her disappearance. His father was friends with Starnes. Smith moved into the building in 2005, after he was paroled from prison where he had been serving a sentence for attempted murder. Following his release he was arrested six times and he admits he was always armed and sold drugs near Yasmin's apartment. He reportedly took an interest in Yasmin, and she mentioned him twice in her diary.

Starnes didn't tell the police that Smith was living in her building until 2009, when he was arrested for raping five females, including two 14-year-old girls he allegedly kidnapped. In a press interview from jail, Smith said he knew what happened to Yasmin and he was responsible for four murders he hadn't been charged with. This information hasn't been confirmed.

Starnes died of natural causes in 2014, at the age of 57. Yasmin's case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.

Patricia Elayne Action,"May 26, 1978","Clearwater, Florida",25,White/Cauasian,"5'4""",96 lbs,"Action was last seen leaving the Ramada Inn Lounge on U. S. 19 north and State Route 60 in Clearwater at 11:30 p.m. on May 26, 1978.

She had moved in with her parents six weeks before her disappearance, after she filed for divorce and was forced to drop out of Stetson University due to an illness. She had recently taken a job at the Kapok Tree Inn. She had just gotten her paycheck and had gone out to the Ramada Inn Lounge that night after work to celebrate with friends.

After about half an hour in the lounge, during which time she had half a drink, Action said she was going to the bathroom and would return in a few minutes. She took her purse with her. The employees didn't notice anything amiss at the time. Action never returned to her friends, never came home and has never been heard from again.

Her parents stated they did not attempt to control her life, but she was always good about keeping them informed where she was and what she was doing. Her parents reported her missing the day after she was last seen.

Four days after Action's disappearance, her car, a white two-door 1969 Chevrolet Malibu, turned up abandoned on U.S. 19 in Tarpon Springs, Florida. She had been raised in that city and graduated from Tarpon Springs High School. Her purse was not inside the vehicle when it was found.

A substantial amount of type O blood was splattered inside the vehicle, on the front seat, floorboard and keys. There was enough blood to indicate someone had sustained a severe, possibly fatal, injury. Authorities couldn't determine whether it was Action's blood, although it was her type. Her shoes were also inside the car, but there was no indication of her whereabouts at the scene.

Action is considered to be missing under suspicious circumstances and foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/patricia-elayne-action,-82.736784,28.013152

Acton's car was found elsewhere after her disappearance.

Curiously, Cherry was arrested for an unrelated homicide in September 2018, and the body of the victim in that case has not been found. He has been charged with first-degree murder in the presumed death of his brother-in-law, Peter Lian, who disappeared in February 2018.

A photo of Cherry is posted with this case summary. He has not been named as a suspect in any other cases, but Acton's co-workers stated she was afraid for her life and told them that if anything happened to her, the police should look at Cherry.

Sarah Elizabeth Burton,"July 17, 2018","Joplin, MO",28,White/Caucasian,"5'7""",120 lbs,"Burton was last seen in Joplin, Missouri on July 17, 2018. A friend dropped her off at a service alley near 10th and Rex, and they parted ways at a business on Range Line Road. Burton planned to walk home from there.

She never arrived and has never been heard from again. Her friend contacted Burton's parents a few days later because Burton had left her purse and one shoe in the friend's car, and her parents reported her missing on July 20.

She last saw her parents on July 8, nine days before her disappearance. Her father had helped her buy a car, and they put the tags on it that day. However, on July 11, she had wrecked the new car in Pittsburg, Kansas. Her parents think she may have been afraid to let them know about the accident and was avoiding them while she tried to figure out what to do.

Burton had been a good student and placed in a program for gifted students, and at Joplin High School she was a cheerleader, but after graduation she struggled with methamphetamine and served a term in prison on a drug charge. She tried to turn her left around after her release, but continued to struggle with drugs and had a troubled relationship with the father of her two young sons.

At the time of her disappearance, she was living with her parents and they were trying to get her into a long-term drug treatment program. She was free on bail on charges of drug possession, trafficking in stolen identities and stealing a motor vehicle, was making all her court appearances, and her attorney thought she might be able to get a suspended sentence. Her parents don't believe she would have run away because of her legal problems.

The circumstances of Burton's disappearance are unclear. Her son's father was incarcerated at the time of her disappearance and isn't a suspect. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/51615

She lived in the 3900 block of south Amber Rock with her husband, James, and their daughter, Jeni. Sachiko and James had recently moved there from Hesperia, California to help Jeni while she underwent treatment for cancer.

On May 1, Jeni's estranged husband, Norman Schrank III, abducted both Jeni and Sachiko from their residence. Two days later, he was found with Jeni, who was bound and injured but alive, in Pine, Arizona. There was no sign of Sachiko, however. Jeni is blind and did not know what had happened to her mother. She was treated for her injuries and resumed her cancer treatments.

Schrank was arrested on multiple charges in connection with the women's kidnappings. Several days later, he was also charged with Sachiko's murder. The charges included second-degree burglary, two counts of kidnapping, one count of first-degree murder, aggravated assault, theft of a vehicle and abandoning or concealing of a dead body or body parts. On May 16, he was found unresponsive in his jail cell. His death was ruled a suicide. Investigators are convinced that he murdered Sachiko and think her body could be in the vicinity of Pine, where he and Jeni were eventually located.

Sachiko's remains have never been found, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.

The girls were abducted by their non-custodial mother, Sonia Elisabeth Coronado, and stepfather, Fernando Pelayo Coria. Felony warrants for kidnapping were issued for the abductors on September 12, 2014. Photos of them are posted with this case summary.

The children had been made wards of the state in May after Sonia and Fernando were arrested on charges of child abuse and neglect; the prosecutor said Fernando severely beat them and that their marks were some of the worst he'd ever seen. Sonia, who was charged with felony child neglect, agreed to testify against him.

Authorities granted temporary custody of the girls to Sonia, and issued an order prohibiting Fernando from contacting any of them. Instead, Sonia and Fernando disappeared with the children.

Sonia's date of birth is August 1, 1986; she was 28 years old at the time of her children's abductions. She's described as Hispanic, 4'0 and 113 pounds, with black hair and black eyes. Fernando's date of birth is May 29, 1990; he was 24 years old. He's described as Hispanic, 5'4 and 160 pounds, with black hair and black eyes.

Although all the children were born in the United States, Sonia is originally from Guatemala and Fernando is from Mexico. Authorities believe the abductors may have taken the children to to Mexico. The children's whereabouts are unknown and their cases remains unsolved.

Shortly before midnight she left the restaurant where she worked, and at 12:27 a.m. she was sighted stepping off a North Quincy MBTA Red Line platform, just 200 yards from her apartment in the 10 block of Hodges Avenue. She has never been heard from again.

After her disappearance, Valibayova's apartment's door was found ajar, her bedroom furniture was out of place, and her laptop, two cellular phones and other personal items were missing. Her U.S. visa, passport and immigration papers were left behind, however, as was the whiteboard where she noted upcoming events. Her boyfriend reported her missing on July 19. That same day, Valibayova's purse, which contained her cellular phones, student identification and checkbook, were found in Dorchester, Massachusetts and turned in to the police.

Police took a second look at Valibayova's apartment three weeks after her disappearance and found a significant amount of her blood in the bedroom, enough to indicate she had been murdered. The carpet was saturated with blood and someone had attempted to clean up the stains. John D. Castonguay, a handyman in her apartment complex, was quickly identified as a suspect in her case.

Castonguay told police he'd never seen or spoken to Valibayova, something her roommate denied. In his capacity as handyman at the complex, he had master keys to all the doors and apartments. He was at her building the day of her disappearance, and he was aware that her roommate had recently moved out and she would be alone. He also admitted he cleaned her apartment after her disappearance.

Castonguay is the prime suspect in Valibayova's presumed murder, but he has never been charged in her case. He pleaded guilty to probation violation after her disappearance and served 15 months in federal prison before being released in 2015.

Since Valibayova's disappearance, she hadn't used her credit card, bank account or Facebook account, and hasn't spoken to any of her friends, her brother, or her parents in Azerbaijan, whom she normally spoke to nightly. She had put a deposit on a new apartment in Brighton, Massachusetts prior to her disappearance and was planning to move to it in September, and sublet a different apartment for August. There's no evidence she was involved in high-risk behavior. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://www.interpol.int/How-we-work/Notices/View-Yellow-Notices#2014-33032

Angela Elaine AllenÊ Ê*,"December 26, 1979","Syracuse, New York",28,Black/African American,"5' 5""",135 lbs,"Angela was last seen in the 3500 block of south Salina Street Syracuse, New York at 2:10 p.m. on December 26, 1979. She spoke to her mother briefly over the telephone that morning, but said she was too sleepy to talk and would call her back later. Angela's mother says her daughter sounded normal during their conversation. She has never been heard from again and authorities don't believe she left of her own accord.

Angela left behind her last paycheck. Her husband, Hubert James ""Mad Dog"" Allen, attempted to pick it up after her disappearance. He's the prime suspect in her case; authorities believe he killed her on the day of her disappearance and disposed of her body. Possible burial sites include Onondaga Indian Nation territory, or the Allied Chemical salt pits in the northern part of the county. Hubert and Angela used to go on dates to both sites.

In October 1985, Hubert was convicted of the murder of his girlfriend, Lorraine Marshall, and their six-year-old son, James Jose Allen. Marshall was found stabbed to death in her apartment in March 1985; James's strangled corpse was found washed up on the shore of Onondaga Lake several weeks later.

Marshall had been seeing Hubert at the time of Angela's disappearance. She refused to cooperate with authorities about Angela's case until 1982, when she began making statements to investigators. Marshall stated that, in December 1979, Hubert had told her he accidentally killed Angela and asked for her assistance in hiding the body. Then he passed the story off as a joke. Marshall said she noticed that his boots were caked with mud after Allen's disappearance.

Authorities believe Hubert killed Marshall and their son because of her cooperation with the police about Allen's disappearance. He was sentenced to fifty years to life in prison for the murders and will not be eligible for parole until 2035; he will be ninety-two years old by then. He has never been charged in connection with Allen's case. Hubert says Allen simply left him without warning one day and he does not know her whereabouts. He also said she took $11,000 in cash from their home when she disappeared, and he did not believe she was dead.

Angela was employed by the department store J.C. Penney at the time of her disappearance. Her mother attempted to have her declared legally dead in 1990, but she was declared legally missing instead. Her estate, including a $10,000 life insurance policy, was distributed to her two daughters.",http://charleyproject.org/case/angela-elaine-allen,-76.1415877,43.0138027

Heidi Marie AllenÊ Ê*,"April 3, 1994","New Haven, New York",18,White/Caucasian,"5' 9"" - 5' 11""
",145 lbs,"Heidi was employed as a clerk at the D & W Convenience Store located at the intersection of New York State Routes 104 and 104B in New Haven, New York in 1994. Heidi opened the business by herself at approximately 5:45 a.m. on April 3, 1994. The last transaction was recorded on the cash register at 7:42 a.m.

A passerby flagged down a sheriff's patrol unit outside the store at approximately 8:15 a.m. and reported that the business was open but unattended. An extensive search produced few clues as to Heidi's whereabouts and she has never been heard from again.

The ensuing investigation revealed that Heidi was most likely taken against her will from the store. Her jacket, purse and car keys were left behind in the store when she vanished, her maroon station wagon was undisturbed in the parking lot, and money was found in the cash register and on the counter.

Richard Thibodeau was charged with Heidi's kidnapping in May 1994, one month after she was last seen. Richard's brother, Gary Thibodeau, was arrested on the same charge in August 1994, three months later. Richard was the last customer known to be in the store before Heidi vanished. He says he purchased two packs of cigarettes at 7:30 a.m. and left.

Gary was convicted of first-degree kidnapping in Heidi's case in June 1995 and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Richard was acquitted of all charges in September 1995. Gary attempted to appeal his conviction, but was denied in 1999. He is expected to remain incarcerated until 2020.

Prior to her disappearance, Heidi's cousin, Melissa Searles, gave her a gold bracelet with her name on it. Searles stated the bracelet mysteriously turned up inside an envelope in her mailbox in 2004, but she didn't tell the police or anyone else about it for years. The reasons for her silence is unclear.

Heidi's abduction got additional attention the summer of 2014, when investigators dug up the floor of a collapsed cabin looking for her body. They didn't find anything in the search, however. Her mother died in 2015 at the age of 66, on what would have been Heidi's 40th birthday.

Heidi was about to graduate from Onondaga Community College with a degree in human services when she disappeared; she hoped to get a career in education or counseling. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance.

A photograph of Ghada and her vital statistics are posted below this case summary. A felony warrant was issued for her on November 17, 1999, nearly three months after she abducted Yousef and Iman.

She had custody of them at the time she took them, but by leaving with the children she deprived their father, Hirsham Almetnawy, of his visitation rights. Ghada, Iman and Yousef may be traveling in a silver 1989 Honda CRS with the Texas license plate number YCJ05P. They may be in New York, Tennessee, California, or Egypt.

Ghada's brother, Yaser Abdel Said, a taxi driver who lived in Lewisville, Texas, was charged with murder on January 2, 2008. He allegedly murdered his two daughters, Amina and Sarah Said, by shooting them in his taxicab in Irving, Texas. Amina was 18 at the time of her death and Sarah was 17; their mother is an American.

The motive was reportedly because the girls had become ""too American"" and were dating non-Muslim boys. Because of this, the girls' murders are considered ""honor killings."" Amina and Sarah had previously accused him of sexual abuse and he had threatened them before.

Yaser fled after his daughters' murders, taking his passport and $9,000 in cash. Photos and vital statistics for him are posted below this case summary. Before the murders he was usually armed, carrying a gun in his taxicab and a knife or other weapon on his person. Yaser has both American and Egyptian passports and ties to New York, Virginia and Egypt, and he frequents IHOP and Denny's chain restaurants.

In spite of extensive national publicity, Yaser has not been located or arrested since them murders. Authorities believe he may be traveling with his sister, niece and nephew; photographs of Ghada and the children were found at his home after the murders. Yaser is considered armed and dangerous and if he is with Ghada, Iman and Yousef, they would be in danger.

Ghada's date of birth is September 4, 1966, making her 32 years old at the time of her children's abductions. She's described as Caucasian, 5'2 and 115 pounds, with black hair and black eyes. Yaser's date of birth is either January 27, 1957 or July 17, 1961, making him either 48 years old or 52 years old when he went on the run in 2008. He's described as Caucasian, 6'2, 180 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.

Both Ghada and Yaser are Egyptian nationals. Yaser has dark brown spots on his neck, primarily on the right side. He had a mustache in 2008 and usually wore dark sunglasses, indoors and out. He smokes Marlboro Light 100's cigarettes. Yaser's first name may be spelled ""Yasir."" He may use the names Yaser Abdel Fattah Mohammed Said and/or Yassein A. Said.

Iman was born in Burbank, California. Her whereabouts and her brother's are unknown and their cases remain unsolved.

Boyd and Alston were planning to go to Winter Haven, Florida, 200 miles away. Alston stated she planned to return the same day, and she did not pack any clothes or personal belongings. Boyd returned several days later, but Alston was not with him and she has never been heard from again. Boyd said she met two other men on the trip, and went away with them.

Boyd was a known crack cocaine addict with violent tendencies in the 1990s. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. He was charged in the 1993 death of a male acquaintance, but pleaded self defense and was acquitted. He was also charged with and acquitted of rape twice.

Boyd convicted of the 1998 murder of Dawnia DaCosta after Alston's disappearance, and sentenced to die. He is presently incarcerated on Florida's death row. He is a suspected serial killer and authorities believe he may be involved in as many as ten unsolved disappearances and murders, including the 1999 disappearance of Danielle Zacot.

Anderson's family doubts she would have attempted to walk the whole distance to her friend's home; it was a cool night and she was feeling ill, possibly as a result of her pregnancy. Her loved ones stated she often accepted rides from people and may have done so on the night of her disappearance.

Her family does not believe she left of her own accord. She has left her home before, but always kept her family informed of her whereabouts. Anderson left behind her purse, jacket and other clothing, billfold, medicine and identification; the only thing she took with her was her cellular phone.

Anderson has a criminal record and several outstanding arrest warrants, but she is not believed to be hiding from the police. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance; authorities and her family believe she may have been murdered.

She got out of her mother's vehicle on Route 92 west near the Pilot Travel Center after an argument with her boyfriend, taking a bag of clothes with her. She has never been heard from again.

Authorities initially believed Anderson had left of her own accord and stated there were possible sightings of her in Tennessee after her disappearance. However, in September 2018, Joseph Samuel James Bauer was charged with complicity to commit murder, complicity to first-degree robbery, complicity to tampering with physical evidence, and complicity to being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun in her death.

A photo of Bauer is posted with this case summary. Investigators believe he and other individuals killed Anderson shortly after she went missing and that her murder was drug-related.

Bauer initially said Anderson's body was thrown off the Savoy Bridge into the Clear Fork River. A search of the area turned up a bone, but it turned out not to be human. When questioned again, Bauer changed his story and said Anderson was buried in a shallow grave in a dry creek bed off a gravel road. Although cadaver dogs indicated the presence of human remains in the area, a search turned up only more animal bones.

Mylette Josephine Anderson,"August 1, 1974","Jacksonville, Florida",6,Caucasian / White,"4'0""",50 lbs,"Mylette and her sister, Lillian ""Annette"" Anderson, disappeared from Jacksonville, Florida on August 1, 1974. Their mother and older sister left them alone at home at approximately 6:00 p.m., while she went to care for a sick relative. Their mother called them at 7:00 p.m. to check on the children and everything was normal during the conversation, but when their aunt called later, no one answered the phone.

The girls' father, a commercial fisherman, was supposed to arrive home from work at 7:00 p.m., but he got delayed by twenty minutes due to a faulty boat motor. When he did get home, Annette and Mylette were nowhere to be found.

Neighbors said they saw a white car in the driveway of the Anderson residence sometime during 6:00 and 7:00 p.m., but nobody saw anything suspicious and no one saw the girls leave. Nothing was missing from the house except a baby doll Mylette owned. The doors to the home were shut, but not locked, and there were no indications of forced entry. The family's small dog, which usually had the run of the house, was shut up in a bedroom. Mylette and Annette were never heard from again.

That year several young girls between six and twelve disappeared from the Jacksonville area. The first was Jean Marie Schoen. Virginia Suzanne Helm vanished on September 27, and Rebecca Ann Greene disappeared on October 12.

Virginia's partially clothed body was found in a shallow grave a month after her disappearance; she had been shot in the head. Rebecca's skeletal remains were found three years later, washed up on the shore of Little Fort George Island at the mouth of the St. Johns River. Both girls were twelve years old when they died. Jean's body and the Anderson sisters' remains were never found.

Because the abductions happened in different parts of the city, authorities don't believe they are related. One suspect in their cases was Paul John Knowles, a serial murderer who was killed by police later in 1974. A photo of him is posted below this case summary. Ima Sanders, whose body wasn't identified until 2011, is another presumed victim of his.

Knowles claimed he killed 35 victims. After his death, they found tape recordings where Knowles said he'd abducted two girls matching the description of the Anderson sisters, killed them and buried them in a remote area at the west end of Commonwealth Avenue. The children's father subsequently filed a wrongful death suit against his estate.

However, Knowles was known for inflating his number of victims, and the police now believe his confession was probably false and he was not involved in the sisters' cases.

The last person to see her was a child who said she was talking to someone driving an older model brown pickup truck. Contrary to some published reports, it isn't clear whether she actually got into the truck. Her mother reported her missing that evening.

April is listed as a runaway with many agencies, but investigators now classify her as a missing person.

She planned to retrieve her purse, which she believed she left at a party the previous evening. She asked multiple friends as well as her sister to accompany her to the site of the party, some farmland, but none of them could go so she decided to go there alone.

According to the tenant of the farm where the party was held, Pflum never arrived arrived at her destination, although a friend reportedly saw her at 2:00 p.m. at a Fashion Bug store on 30th Street. She didn't have any identification when she left home, or the carrying case or cleaning solution for her contact lenses. She has never been heard from again.

The following day, a farmer from Glenwood, Indiana reported that Pflum's cream-colored 1981 Buick Regal, which was registered to her parents, had been locked and abandoned alongside Tower Road, a rural gravel road east of Glenwood, since between 12:30 and 1:15 p.m. the day she went missing. This spot was all the way across the county from where she lived, and three miles from the party site; her family can't think of a reason why she would have gone there. There were no indications of a struggle at the scene.

In July 2020, Shawn M. McClung was arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter in Pflum's presumed death. The charge indicates authorities believe McClung killed Pflum in the heat of the moment, without premeditation and without using a deadly weapon. He was Pflum's ex-boyfriend and had previously claimed Pflum was still alive, but had recently admitted he had killed her in March 1986. At the time of McClung's confession, he was suffering from a terminal illness. He died in September 2020 at the of 56, just months after he was charged in Pflum's case and before he could face trial.

George and Apgar had had a stormy relationship and he was involved with a motorcycle gang based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Apgar was reportedly very afraid of him and his gang associates, and she told her family to contact police if they didn't hear from her every day.

Anna Marie Arguello,"November 1, 1969","Frankfort, Indiana",2,Native American,,,"Anna Marie lived with her mother, Anita Maria Vega, her stepfather, Luis Vega Sr., and six siblings, including her nine-year-old sister, Margarita, at the time of her disappearance. She disappeared sometime in the winter of 1969 - 1970 and has not been seen again.

Police were unaware of Anna Marie's disappearance until Margarita went to them in the autumn of 1992. By then she was 33 years old. Margarita stated her mother had severely beaten Anna Marie, deprived her of food, forced her to take a bath in cold water and held her head under the water until she drowned.

Several hours later, Anita wrapped Anna Marie's naked body in an Army blanket and put it in a cardboard box from the turkey farm where Luis worked. Luis took the box away after he came home from work. Margarita overheard him telling Anita he buried Anna Marie's body near the railroad trestles in Frankfort, which are known as ""the viaducts.""

In 1985, Anita showed Margarita a sack of dirt and bones and said they were Anna Marie's remains. Several months later, Margarita asked her mother what she'd done with the sack and Anita said she'd buried it at a fresh grave in the Bunnell Cemetery.

Margarita told police she hadn't come forward before because her mother had threatened to kill her. She went to law enforcement with her story after spending a month in a California mental health facility getting treatment for anxiety.

Margarita had talked about her sister's death during therapy sessions at the facility, and the staff told her that if she didn't report what had happened, they would. She took a polygraph about her statement, but the results were inconclusive. Police went to the Bunnell Cemetery and sifted through the dirt at the grave Margarita indicated, but found only turkey bones.

When police investigated Margarita's claims, they could find very little evidence for Anna Marie's existence, only her birth certificate and a single photograph of her. Anita's other children denied Margarita's story, and one of them, Guadalupe Thomas, was ultimately indicted for lying to authorities; she had told a grand jury she didn't remember her mother forcing the children to take cold baths as punishment.

Thomas pleaded guilty to perjury and agreed to testify against Anita at her trial. A photograph of Anita is posted with this case summary. She was charged with involuntary manslaughter in October 1993. Luis died in the mid-1980s, before police realized his role in covering up his stepdaughter's death.

When questioned by police, Anita at first denied Anna Marie's existence. After police confronted her with the child's birth certificate, she changed her story and implied that Margarita had killed the child.

When police pointed out that Margarita had only been nine years old at the time, Anita said Luis had killed Anna Marie, then changed her story again and said she found Anna Marie dead in bed. She stated she had kept the death a secret because Luis, whom she claimed was abusive, had threatened her. Luis, she said, was afraid he would be deported to Mexico if they reported Anna Marie's death.

At Anita's trial, Margarita testified about witnessing her sister's murder and Thomas partially corroborated the story, saying she had seen Anna Marie's body. Anita's attorney suggested Margarita had made up the murder story to get revenge on her mother for not supporting her when she told her Luis had sexually abused her.

Anita was convicted; the jury deliberated only 15 minutes before bringing in the guilty verdict. She was sentenced to one to ten years in prison and served three. Her other children supported her and are now estranged from Margarita. Anna Marie's body has never been found.

The photo of Anna Marie is at approximately 15 months of age (approximately one and a half years prior to her disappearance; no other photographs of her are available",http://charleyproject.org/case/anna-marie-arguello,-87.8509873,41.4971349

Armstead's estranged husband, Tony Bledsoe, is a person of interest in her case. There was a history of domestic violence in their relationship and they were going through a divorce. Armstead was in the process of moving from Memphis to St. Louis, Missouri at the time of her disappearance; she had decided to relocate to get away from Bledsoe after he broke her jaw. Armstead had an order of protection against Bledsoe and after she disappeared, police arrested him for violating it. This was because, although the order required him to stay away from her, she was seen twice with him on the day she disappeared.

It's uncharacteristic of Armstead to leave without warning, and her family doesn't believe she would have abandoned her three sons. Foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.

Her husband said they got into an argument about their two young sons, who were away from home at the time. Arnhold left the house angrily and without saying where she was going or when she would be back. She has never been heard from again.

Shortly before midnight on July 29, her black and green 1967 Mercury Cougar was found on Levee Road under the Meridian Street overpass. There were no signs of a struggle or any evidence of foul play at the scene. Divers searched the nearby Puyallup River for clues, but found nothing.

Although Arnhold was having marital problems and planned to file for divorce, her family doesn't believe she would have walked out of her life. Arnhold had numerous plans for the future when she disappeared: she had found a dog to breed her prize purebred Rottweiler with, she planned to visit her sisters in California a week after her disappearance, and she was within a week of graduating from Tacoma Community College, where she was a straight-A student.

She had been working as a licensed practical nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup, Washington for about eighteen months, and it was uncharacteristic of her to miss work. She was attending college to get certified as a registered nurse.

Foul play is possible in Arnhold's case; it remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/marilyn-anne-arnhold,-122.312899,47.2481558
Dorothy Harriet Camille Arnold,"December 12, 1910","Manhattan, New York",25,Caucasian / White,"5'1"" - 5'4""
",140 lbs - 160 lbs,"Arnold was a member of a prominent millionaire family in New York City in 1910. Her father was an established perfume importer and her family had high social standing as a result. Arnold was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and fluent in several languages, was attempting to gain notice as a writer. She resided with her family in a mansion on east 79th Street in the borough of Manhattan in 1910.

Arnold departed from her home during the morning hours of December 12; she told her mother she was going shopping for a new evening gown. Arnold's mother offered to accompany her but Arnold said she wanted to go alone. She walked to 5th Avenue and turned south. A clerk at the Park and Tilford's candy store who sold Arnold some chocolates at 1:45 p.m. said she was in good spirits.

Arnold bought a book at Brentano's, a bookstore on 27th and Fifth, and had a chance encounter with a friend in the store; they chatted for a few minutes before Arnold left the establishment. She said she was going for a walk in Central Park. She was supposed to meet her mother for lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel that day but never kept the appointment.

Arnold has never been heard from again. Her family believes she had approximately $25 or $30 in cash on her the day she vanished.

Arnold's parents did not initially worry when she did not return home that evening; they assumed she was spending the night with a friend. When she did not come home on the second night, her parents became concerned. Her family did not initially contact the police because they were afraid of negative publicity; they hired private investigators to search for her instead.

No evidence was located as to her whereabouts, and when police were informed of her disappearance several months later, their search turned up nothing either. Arnold's father believed that she had been murdered and disposed of in a reservoir in Central Park in December 1910, but nothing was found to support his theory. Her disappearance was widely publicized and her photograph was published in newspapers all over the United States and in Europe, but the publicity yielded no viable yields.

In the investigation into Arnold's disappearance, it was discovered that she had rented a post office box in the months prior to vanishing. She kept the box's existence a secret from her loved ones. It is believed that Arnold used the box to keep rejected manuscripts from being found out by her family.

Authorities discovered that Arnold had been secretly dating George C. Griscom Jr., a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania engineer in his forties, at the time of her disappearance. He was from a wealthy Pittsburghfamily.

Arnold spent a week with her boyfriend several months prior to the time she vanished; she had told her family she was going to visit some college friends but went to see Griscom instead. On the way home from her tryst, she pawned $500 worth of jewelry for $60.

Griscom was in Florence, Italy in December 1910. He participated in the search for Arnold and stated that when she was found, he would marry her. Griscom denied any involvement in Arnold's disappearance and gave her family a letter she had written to him earlier in 1910. The note stated that one of her short stories had been rejected by the editorial staff of a magazine. Arnold insinuated that she was depressed as a result.

Authorities investigated the possibility that Arnold had staged her disappearance; before she vanished, she had asked to be allowed to move out of her parents' home and her father refused to let her go. However, the voluntarily disappearance theory was largely discredited as the months passed and none of Arnold's loved ones heard from her.

Some people believed that Arnold took her own life; others theorized she had been pregnant and died in a botched abortion. Area hospitals were checked for patients who fit Arnold's description, as some investigators thought she may have been injured and did not recall her identity. There was no evidence Arnold was admitted to any medical facility in New York City.

Arnold's case is no longer under investigation due to the amount of time that has passed since she vanished, but her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Dorothy_Arnold

Kali Soleil Athukorala,"December 1, 2007","Belchertown, Massachusetts",4 Months,Asian and Caucasian (Polish and Sri Lankan descent.),"1'6""",26 lbs,"Kali's mother, Sandra Clarissa Zemialkowski, took the child to the Dominican Republic in December 2007. She told Kali's father, Dhanika Athukorala, that it was a two-month visit to relatives, and Dhanika consented to this. Zemialkowski failed to return with Kali in February 2008, however, and Dhanika sought a court order to compel her to give Kali back.

After some negotiation, the parents agreed that Sandra was to set up a webcam so Dhanika could keep in touch with Kali, and she was to bring Kali to the United States for a visit one week every three months. In addition, Dhanika would be permitted to travel to the Dominican Republic to see his daughter whenever he liked. Sandra didn't abide by the agreement, however, and obstructed Dhanika's access to the child. He was only allowed to see Kali a few times, and never for overnight, which was contrary to what Sandra had promised. Her attorney in Massachusetts told the family court judge she had no intention of coming to court or taking Kali to see her father. The judge then granted custody of Kali to Dhanika, and ordered Sandra to return her by April 13, 2009. Sandra never did, and Dhanika hasn't seen or had contact with his daughter since the custody ruling.

Sandra and Kali are believed to be living with Sandra's parents, Walter R. Zemialkowski and Clara Violeta Zemialkowski, in the Dominican capital city of Santo Domingo. Both Walter and Clara are United States citizens, like their daughter. Sandra is apparently working as a veternarian at the Pet Land Veterinary Hospital in Santo Domingo.

Dhanika is trying to arrange for Kali's return to the United States under the terms of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, an international civil treaty which the Dominican Republic signed in 2007. The Dominican Republic has refused to take action, however, saying Sandra was within her rights when she moved there with Kali and because Sandra and Dhanika were never married, Dhanika has no say as to where their daughter lives.

Kali's disappearance remains unsolved; although her whereabouts are known, she is classified as missing because she is not with her custodial father.

Diane Louise Augat,"April 10, 1998","Odessa, Florida",40,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",130 lbs,"Augat was last seen leaving her residence in the 1000 block of Chesapeake Drive in Odessa, Florida at approximately 11:00 a.m. on April 10, 1998. A witness observed Augat walking north on U. S. 19 near New York Avenue in Hudson, Florida on April 11, the day after Augat left her home. She has never been heard from again. Augat did not have her medication with her when she walked away from her residence.

Augat's mother received a phone call from her daughter on April 13, three days after she disappeared. No one was home at the time the call came through and the answering machine recorded the message.

Augat said, ""Help, help, let me out,"" while a noise consistent with someone attempting to grab the phone away from her was overheard. Augat was heard saying, ""Hey, gimme that,"" before the call was terminated. Caller ID stated that the call was placed from a business called Starlight in the Odessa area. Augat's mother dialed the number, but no one answered.

The severed tip of Augat's right middle finger, cut off just above the knuckle with the nail painted red, was located on the roadside in the U.S. 19/New York Avenue area on April 15, 1998. Her finger was discovered in the same area where the witness reported seeing Augat on April 11. A second finger was also reported, but law enforcement was able to recover only one of them. A bag of Augat's neatly folded clothing was discovered inside a convenience store's outdoor freezer in Odessa two weeks after she was reported missing.

In 2000, just one day after the St. Petersburg Times, a Florida newspaper, ran a story on Augat's disappearance, another bag was found at a Circle K convenience store in Pasco, Florida. It was discovered by Augat's brother's girlfriend. The clear zip-top plastic bag was labeled ""Diane"" in black marker, and contained black eyeliner, Taboo perfume, a tube of bright pink lipstick, and a tube of generic toothpaste

Augat's mother says the makeup and perfume were items her daughter would have owned, and she was issued a similar tube of toothpaste when she was released from a mental hospital a few weeks before she disappeared. Investigators have not been able to confirm that the bag or its contents were Augat's possessions, however.

Augat's mother stated that her daughter was a stay-at-home mother in the 1970s and early 1980s. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the late 1980s and only took her medication occasionally. Augat's three children were taken from her custody in 1988. She and her husband divorced in 1991.

Augat was arrested several times during the following years for minor offenses. Her mother said that Augat had been taken into custody at least 32 times under Florida's Baker Act, which allows a physician, judge or law enforcement officer to determine if an individual requires an involuntary medical exam.

One of the last places Augat was seen at before her disappearance was the Coral Sands Motel, which was managed by Gary Robert Evers and his girlfriend. In 2001, Evers was charged with murder; he allegedly shot and killed a man during an argument. He has no prior criminal record in the state Florida. Evers is considered a possible suspect in Augat's disappearance, but has not been charged in connection with it.

Augat had been treated at a mental health facility several weeks prior to her April 1998 disappearance. Her mother believed that she should not have been released, as Augat required institutionalized care. Her case remains unsolved. Authorities believe that foul play is likely in her disappearance.

Some agencies state that Augat's residence was in the 12000 block of Cobblestone Drive in Hudson, Florida in 1998.",http://charleyproject.org/case/diane-louise-augat,-82.5756348,28.1763663
Julia Christine Aul,"January 9, 2001","Havre de Grace, Maryland",39,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",165 lbs,"Aul was last seen at the Maryland Transportation Authority office at the Hatem Bridge in Havre de Grace, Maryland on January 9, 2001. She'd gone there to visit her live-in girlfriend, who worked there. The two women had a verbal argument and Aul drove away angry. She has never been heard from again. Her girlfriend notified the police that evening that she hadn't come home, but an official missing persons report wasn't filed until January 12.

Aul never picked up her last paycheck from her job at a Pep Boys auto parts store in Bel Air, Maryland. She had only been working there for a few days before her disappearance. Her blue 1997 Geo Tracker disappeared with her and was found locked and abandoned about a month later on Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore City, Maryland, in an area known for its drug activity.

Investigators took the car into evidence and examined it carefully, but found no evidence of foul play and no indication as to Aul's whereabouts. She had no friends or contacts in the Baltimore City area.

Aul and her girlfriend didn't have a history of domestic violence in their relationship, and her girlfriend isn't considered a suspect in her disappearance. Her ex-husband, who now lives in Georgia, has also been ruled out as a suspect.

Aul led a somewhat transient lifestyle before her disappearance and had no credit cards or bank account in 2001, making her very difficult to trace. She was released from a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility just a few weeks before her disappearance, and may have relapsed right before she went missing.

Aul's mother and sister lived in Pennsylvania in 2001. Aul was close to her mother and kept in close touch with her. Her mother is now deceased. Police have lost track of Aul's girlfriend, but they are still in touch with her sister.

Authorities are uncertain what caused Aul's disappearance or whether she is still alive. The circumstances of her disappearance are unclear. Aul suffers from schizophrenia and requires medication to control her condition. ",http://charleyproject.org/case/julia-christine-aul,-76.0924626,39.5495867

Laura Ayala,"March 10, 2002","Houston, Texas",13,Hispanic / Latina,"4'0""",90 lbs,"Laura resided in an apartment complex in the 7930 block of Serita Street in Houston, Texas. She asked her mother for money to purchase a newspaper for a school assignment during the evening hours of March 10, 2002.

Laura departed from her home at approximately 10:15 p.m. and walked to the Broadway Convenience Store, which is less than 100 feet behind her residence. The store is housed inside the Conoco gas station in the 2600 block of Broadway Street. An employee told authorities that Laura arrived at the store alone and bought a newspaper, then left shortly afterwards. She has never been heard from again.

Laura's mother became concerned when her daughter failed to return home and walked to the store herself. She reported Laura as a missing child shortly thereafter. Laura's shoes and her newspaper were discovered scattered inside a parking lot between her apartment complex and the gas station later that evening. An extensive search of the area produced no clues as to her whereabouts.

Witnesses reported observing a full-size, mid-1980s red/maroon cargo van near the store around the time of Laura's disappearance. The vehicle was two-tone and had a large-sized white or light-colored stripe painted along its center and had a gray-colored bumper. The sliding door on the right side of the van had a window; witnesses said that the window behind the door may have been missing and plywood concealed its opening. It was apparently a work-related vehicle and appeared to be faded and in worn condition. Additional reports stated that the van had rear windows, but may have been missing its side windows. A photo of a similar vehicle is posted with this case summary.

A resident near Broadway Street reported seeing the van at approximately 10:00 p.m. on the night of Laura's disappearance. The witness did not contact law enforcement officials until April 2002, one month after Laura vanished; he stated that at the time he had not realized the significance of what he saw. He said the van's sliding door was open and reported observing an unidentified Hispanic or Caucasian male near the scene. The vehicle was parked in the same lot where Laura's shoes and newspaper were discovered.

In February 2003, Laura's disappearance was linked to three men: Walter Alexander Sorto, Edgardo Rafael Cubas, and Eduardo Navarro. Photographs of Sorto and Cubas are posted with this case summary. Sorto is from El Salvador and Cubas is from Honduras. They went on a crime spree of robberies, rapes and murders in the predominantly Hispanic east side of Houston. Navarro was charged with driving the getaway car; he was not directly involved in the murders.

Blood found in a SUV belonging to Cubas's father was linked to Laura's DNA. Cubas admitted that he, Sorto, and Navarro occasionally borrowed the vehicle. Semen matching one of the suspects was also located in the car. Cubas and Sorto were charged with capital murder in the deaths of two adult waitresses and a fifteen-year-old girl. Navarro was charged in the same offenses, but could not face the death penalty because he was only fifteen years old at the time of the crimes.

Sorto and Cubas were ultimately convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death; both are awaiting execution. Navarro pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated robbery and was sentenced to thirteen years in prison. None of the suspects were charged in Laura's case due to lack of evidence.

Laura's favorite color is maroon and her favorite number is one. She is described as having a shy, reserved nature and is very organized. She enjoys journal-keeping and records her activities.

Mary Edna Badaracco,"August 19, 1984","Sherman, Connecticut",38,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",145 lbs,"Mary was employed as a house cleaner in Sherman, Connecticut in 1984. She had a stormy relationship with her husband, Dominic Badaracco Sr., and had left him for short periods of time in the past. Shortly before she disappeared, Mary found out Dominic was having an affair. He had a history of infidelity as well as domestic violence. She decided to file for divorce. Mary's adult daughters last heard from her on August 19. They reported her missing on August 31.

Dominic claimed that he saw Mary for the last time on August 20, when she packed all of her belongings and left their residence in the 20 block of Wakeman Hill Road. None of Mary's personal items were located inside the house by her daughters. Her 1982 Chevrolet Cavalier was parked outside of their home, at the end of the long driveway. The windshield on the driver's side of the vehicle had been smashed inward and shards of glass were on the front seat. A photo of the car is posted with this case summary.

Mary's car keys and her wedding ring were placed on the kitchen counter. Her clothes were missing, as were all of the framed photos of her. Dominic claimed that he gave Mary between $100,000 and $250,000 to leave their residence and as an informal settlement. He maintained that she simply packed her things and left after receiving the cash.

Mary's daughters had a close relationship with Mary in 1984. One of her daughters had just given birth to Mary's first grandchild, and the other was engaged to be married at the time. Other loved ones stated she would never leave the vicinity without sharing her plans. Dominic told Mary's children not to tell anyone she was gone. When they reported her disappearance, he told the police she'd left him. He admitted having smashed her car windshield. The police decided not to seize the vehicle, as there was no evidence of foul play. The car disappeared sometime later and has never been located. There's no record of it being sold or given away.

A woman and her daughters moved in with Dominic less than a week after Mary disappeared. Dominic said he had moved in with his sister and was only renting his house to the woman, but he later married her. Two days before Mary was reported missing, Dominic filed for divorce on grounds of abandonment. Divorce proceedings for Mary and Dominic took place in August 1985, nine months after she vanished. Mary was not represented at the hearing and Dominic continued to insist that she left their home after accepting his cash offering. There has not been any evidence of the cash or any trace of Mary's belongings since her disappearance.

Mary's case was upgraded from a missing person's case to a homicide in 1990, six years after she disappeared. Investigators received a tip from an informant that Mary was killed after members of The Hell's Angels motorcycle gang issued a contract on her life. Dominic's son Joseph, who has a criminal record for arson, is a member of the gang. Reportedly, Joseph and an accomplice, Steve Kendall, killed Mary because she was going to go to the police with incriminating information about Dominic.

Joseph was interviewed in prison, but he refused to cooperate. Kendall refused to be interviewed, but he did take a lie detector test, which he reportedly failed. He was later killed in a motorcycle accident. The tip has never been confirmed. No charges have been filed in Mary's disappearance.

Authorities searched the backyard of Ernest Dachenhausen's former home in September 2007, and also brought him to the search site. He said he knew Dominic, but he had nothing to do with Mary's disappearance. Some buried cars were located during the search.

In April 2008, Dachenhausen was charged with a misdemeanor count of interfering with a police investigation in Mary's disappearance. Authorities stated he gave false and leading information to the police. At the trial, authorities identified Dominic as the prime suspect in Mary's presumed death. Dachenhausen was acquitted at his trial in May 2009.

Dominic was convicted of attempted bribery in connection with Mary's disappearance in June 2013. He had attempted to interfered with the grand jury probe into Mary's disappearance by offering the presiding judge $100,000. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.

Mary has eleven siblings. She attended Danbury High School, but dropped out at sixteen to marry her first husband. They had two daughters and divorced a few years later. Mary worked sporadically as a bartender and a housecleaner after the divorce, and frequently changed residences. She enjoyed painting and drawing as a hobby. She married Dominic in 1970. He has four children from a prior marriage.

Some agencies may list Southbury, Connecticut as the location of Mary's disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/mary-edna-badaracco,-73.497418,41.5786417

Tavia typically dated African-American men at the time of her disappearance and may have been in the company of one after she went missing.

Tavia's mother stated her daughter had emotional and behavioral problems as a result of being sexually abused by her stepfather when she was eight years old. She received psychotherapy and spent time in group homes to help her recover from the psychological trauma, but by the age of twelve was she sexually active and involved with drugs.

Tavia had run away several times before, once traveling as far as New York City, but she always kept in touch with her mother. After her December 1985 disappearance, she never called home again.

Yolanda Yvette Baker,"August 1, 1999",Washington D.C.,35,African American / Black,"5'9""",160 lbs,"Yolanda Baker was last seen in Washington D.C. at approximately 3:00 a.m. on August 1, 1999. She was at her residence in the 400 block of 44th Street northeast at the time of her disappearance. Baker has never been heard from again. She was reported missing on August 4. Her 1999 Toyota Corolla was found abandoned nearly a week after her disappearance. There were drops of her blood in the trunk, which emitted a foul odor.

Baker was declared legally dead in February 2009. A cold case squad took over the investigation around that time and, in June 2009, Terrance Barnett was charged with her murder.

Barnett was Baker's boyfriend and the father of her twins. They had been a couple for seven years, living together off and on, and he was reportedly abusive towards her. Baker's loved ones had often seen her with injuries, such as bruises and hair pulled out of her scalp. She got an eighteen-month restraining order against Barnett in 1997; the order expired in early 1999 and she began seeing him again. She also sought child support from him.

One of Baker's sisters reported seeing Barnett just hours after Baker was last seen. She says she saw him on a bridge, pulling a large plastic-wrapped object out of the trunk of his car. His DNA, mixed with Baker's, was found on the walls, ceiling and floor of the house they shared, as well as the shirt Barnett was wearing the night Baker disappeared. Someone had tried to clean up the house with bleach and the carpet in the master bedroom was missing.

Barnett's attorney stated he is innocent and the DNA of two other men was found in the trunk of Baker's car, while Barnett's DNA was not present. These same men were reportedly seen driving Baker's car after her disappearance.

After three days of deliberation, a jury convicted Barnett of second-degree murder in March 2010. He'd been charged with first-degree murder, but the jury couldn't find sufficient evidence to prove he had planned Baker's killing. Foul play is suspected in Baker's case due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/7972

The circumstances of Baliton's disappearance are unclear. Her employers are afraid for her safety, as she was unfamiliar with the United States.

Her mother said that Darlene filed for a restraining order against Earl during the summer of 2001. The couple continued to live together in their home in the 37400 block of Terrain Court.

Darlene phoned her mother at approximately 4:00 a.m. on August 13, 2001. She said that she had insomnia and was resting on the couch with her four-year-old daughter. Darlene told her mother she planned to take her brown station wagon to the mechanic for a maintenance check soon. She also mentioned she needed a manicure.

Darlene planned to take her child and relocate to the Dallas, Texas area later in the month. Her family said that she wanted to move away from Earl and decided to drive to Texas with her brother. Darlene did not have any immediate travel plans on the day of her disappearance.

Darlene was last seen dropping her daughter off at a daycare center during the day. She has never been heard from again. Earl claimed first that Darlene had taken all her clothes and departed the residence in a Lincoln or Cadillac parked by the street. Later he said Darlene drove away in her station wagon and took their child with her, but authorities saw that their daughter was still at home. Darlene's vehicle was also parked in the driveway of their residence.

Earl changed his version of his wife's disappearance several times before claiming that Darlene departed in an unknown vehicle. Earl claimed that she had called him several times after August 13, but authorities have been unable to confirm that statement. Most of Darlene's clothes and personal belongings, including her makeup, perfume and toiletries, were discovered inside the couple's home.

Earl had an extensive criminal history, with forty-two arrests for crimes such as for attempted murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, felony possession of a firearm, grand larceny, theft and selling cocaine. He had been married six times, according to Florida state records. One of his wives died in a reported suicide. Another of Earl's former wives stated that he was abusive, but he was never convicted of domestic violence.

Earl died of natural causes in April 2002, in the home he had shared with Darlene. He was fifty-four years old. His and Darlene's daughter was removed from his custody after Darlene disappeared and placed in the care of Darlene's mother.

Lemon stated that their relationship was ""rocky"" and he and Baremore argued after she arrived home on the morning of her disappearance.

The driver's side window was open and the keys were in the ignition. Some of Barkley's belongings were inside the vehicle, which was low on gas. A photo of the car is posted with this case summary.

A witness reported seeing a man driving Barkley's car at a self-serve car wash on U.S. 19 in Port Richey, Florida after her disappearance. A sketch of the suspect is posted with this case summary.

He is described as Caucasian, with dark blond hair and a few days' growth of light-colored facial hair. One of his legs was wrapped in a bandage and the man offered the witness money to wash his car for him, saying his injury made it hard for him to do it himself. He would have been in his mid- to late-20s in 1981, and was 5'10 and 160 pounds.

Mark Cutler matched the description of the man at the car wash, and he had bragged that he knew what happened to Barkley.

They were supposed to rendezvous at Barnes's sister's car, but Barnes never showed up and has never been seen again.

Barnes had been reported missing before when she got lost while hiking, but was found safe and was angry at her family for sending out a search party. As a result, this time her family waited 30 hours before informing the authorities.

Barnes may have been spotted on the day of her disappearance by a man who said she told him she was going back to her sister's car. Another witness might have seen Barnes at the valley of Rogue State Park. Tracker dogs traced her scent to the off-ramp of north Interstate 5. Police believe she walked down Sardine Creek Road to the highway. Two residents of the neighborhood reported having seen her. None of these sightings have been confirmed.

At the time of her disappearance, she lived with her boyfriend, Robert Alurac, in the 5800 block of Rapp Street. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary.

Authorities believe another man, Ronald Talmage, picked up Barrett at her home at noon. He was driving a borrowed dark green 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the Colorado license plate number PBE6081. They may have traveled southwest of Colorado Springs, Colorado that day, possibly to Highway 24, Highway 42 or the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument, that day.

Barrett has never been heard from again. On July 23, Alurac's body was found outside a home for sale in the 8400 block of Scenic Drive near Morrison, Colorado. A real estate estate agent discovered the body. He had been shot to death, and had been dead for several days by the time he was discovered. He was not identified until August 3.

Talmadge, who served time in prison for weapons charges, was wanted for questioning about Alurac's murder, as he was considered a person of interest. On August 5, he was shot and killed by the Douglas County SWAT Team outside of the Super 8 Motel in the 6200 block of Pine Lane in Parker, Colorado. Police were attempting to arrest him when he pulled out a gun and threatened the officers. After his death he was found to be carrying three guns. The shooting was ruled a justifiable homicide.

Barrett is described as a streetwise, opinionated woman. She left behind a teenage daughter. She was married at one time, but divorced in 1987. Authorities believe she may be in danger due to the circumstances surrounding her disappearance. She is not considered a suspect in her boyfriend's death, but investigators believe she could provide information about his murder.

There is a warrant out for Barrett's arrest in an unrelated case; she failed to appear in court in May 2007 to answer to a charge of drinking alcohol in public. Her disappearance remains unsolved, as does Alurac's murder.",http://charleyproject.org/case/colleen-kay-barrett,-105.0199455,39.6118704

On October 11, the day after Barrington's disappearance, her silver four-door Kia was found stuck and abandoned three miles from the hospital, northbound on Highway 17, near where she was allegedly seen. Her purse and most of her other personal belongings were inside but her pager and car keys were missing. Her parents reported her missing that same day.

In July 2004, over a year and a half after Barrington disappeared, authorities charged her boyfriend, Thomas Jessie Crews Jr., with second-degree murder in connection with her case.

He was convicted of her murder in September 2006 and sentenced to life in prison. A photograph of Crews is posted with this case summary.

A photo of Cocoa is posted with this case summary. Bastian left many of her belongings at her friend's house, including her wallet, identification and glasses, even though she would have needed the glasses in order to see.

That same night, the California Highway Patrol found some of Bastian's belongings on the road near Highway 247 and Bodick Road in Johnson Valley, California. Later that same morning, her silver two-door 1500 Dodge Ram pickup truck, which she had only owned for a week, was found abandoned near Valley View Road and Twentynine Palms Highway in Morongo Valley, California. It had dents and scratches on both sides, as if it had been driven over rough desert terrain.

An Apple Valley woman found Cocoa near the intersection of Bear Valley Road and Highway 18 on November 1, the same date Bastian disappeared, and took her home with her. The woman put a photo of Cocoa on an ad page about lost and found animals, and a friend of Bastian's mother saw the ad and told her family, who contacted the woman and verified that the dog she found was Bastian's. As they were busy searching for Bastian, they left Cocoa in the woman's care.

On November 11, someone found a backpack containing Bastian's belongings on a dirt road near Bear Valley Road and Central Roads. A search of the area turned up no further evidence.

Bastian quit taking her bipolar disorder medicine a few months before she disappeared. At first she seemed to be doing well and said God had healed her. She taught freshman and sophomore English at Silverado High School and was working on getting a master's degree, as well as saving money to buy her own home.

However, just a few days before she disappeared, she told people someone had broken into her apartment on Laguna Road in Apple Valley. She began acting paranoid and erratic after the break-in, and was too frightened to remain in her apartment. She took some of her most precious belongings and left to stay with others.

She took the SIM card out of her phone and then broke the phone, and drove from Apple Valley to Phoenix, Arizona and back, about 700 miles round-trip, the day before she disappeared. She spoke to her brother-in-law and said she ""didn't want to be Christina Bastian anymore"" and wanted to ""disappear."" She was deep in debt from student loans and was considering taking a break from her job, so she could decide what to do with herself.

Bastian's family believes she may have decided to walk out of her life, but because of her mental illness and because it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning, they're concerned for her safety. They stated she enjoys writing fictional stories and is a devout Christian. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/christina-lynn-bastian,-117.1858759,34.5008311

He was arrested in July 2003, a month after her disappearance, and charged with six counts involving a seven-year-old boy, and authorities believe he had abused an eight-year-old as well.

Plata stated that prior to her disappearance, Baxter had been a loving mother who cooked for the family, helped her children with their homework and was involved in the Girl Scouts. She looked through the house herself after her mother's disappearance and found Baxter's purse and driver's license hidden in the attic.

Plata believes her father either killed her or arranged for someone else to do it, but Baxter's husband is now deceased and was never charged in her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved and she is considered missing under suspicious circumstances.

Authorities determined Allison took a the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train from her Danville, California home to the Embarcadero stop in San Francisco and then rode her bike nine miles across the city to the Golden Gate Bridge. She jumped from the bridge at approximately 10:00 a.m. the day of her disappearance. She left behind suicide notes for her family and friends, and her computer history showed she'd looked up directions to the bridge.

Carolyn Maryann Bealer,"August 23, 1979","Garden Grove, California",25,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",110 lbs,"Bealer was last seen in her hometown of Garden Grove, California on August 23, 1979. She has never been seen again. After her disappearance, her car was found abandoned on the Garden Grove Freeway with its lights flashing. She called her brother, Larry Fox, later that day to say she'd been kidnapped and was being held for a $100,000 ransom.

Larry Donald Smith, an acquaintance of both Bealer and her brother, admitted he'd picked up Bealer from the freeway. He was subsequently charged, along with two accomplices, with threatening violence in the ransom plot. He told authorities that Bealer was a willing participant in the kidnapping and extortion, which was in retaliation for Fox's alleged theft of over a million dollars from Smith and his associates, whom he named as only ""Jack"" and ""Ray.""

Smith said the men pressured him into taking part in the scheme. He stated he took Bealer to a cabin on Lake Arrowhead on the evening of the day she disappeared, then took her out on his boat the next day and traveled to Dana Point, California. Jack and Ray boarded the boat and ordered him to leave. Smith stayed on the dock and the two men and Bealer left in the boat, and Jack and Ray returned to shore without her about 30 to 45 minutes later.

Smith was charged with Bealer's abduction and presumed murder shortly after she vanished. Small blood stains on his shirt were matched to Bealer's blood type taken from samples of her menstrual blood on her panties. Authorities believe that Smith disposed of Bealer's remains in the Pacific Ocean. He was convicted of the charges and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1980, one year after Bealer disappeared. Her remains have never been recovered.

Bealer was born and raised in the Fontana, California area. She graduated from Bloomington High School in 1972. She and her husband divorced a few months prior to her disappearance.

Denise Beaudin,"November 26, 1981","Goffstown, New Hampshire",23,Caucasian / White,"5'4"" - 5'6""
",120 lbs - 140 lbs,"Denise was last seen on November 26, 1981, when she and her boyfriend, whom she knew as Robert T. ""Bob"" Evans, went to eat Thanksgiving dinner with her family in Goffstown, New Hampshire. On December 1, Denise's family went to visit her at her home in the 900 block of Hayward Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. Denise lived there with Evans and her six-month-old daughter, Dawn.

No one was home when her parents stopped by, and Denise's family never heard from her again. Because the couple had been having financial problems, Denise's family initially assumed they'd left on their own.

Photos of ""Evans"" are posted with this case summary. He used numerous alias names throughout his life and multiple dates of birth, ranging between 1936 and 1952.

In August 2017, Evans was identified as Terrance Peder Rasmussen, who was born in Colorado in 1943. He grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, dropped out of high school after his sophomore year, and enlisted in the Navy in 1961. During his time in service he worked as an electrician on naval bases across the western U.S., as well as in Okinawa, Japan.

After his discharge in 1967, Rasmussen moved to Hawaii, married and had four children. He and his wife lived in Hawaii, Arizona and California during their marriage. His wife took the children and left him in 1973, and he dropped out of their lives; they last saw him in Payson, Arizona in 1975 or 1976 when he unexpectedly arrived at their home. He was accompanied by an unidentified woman at the time and said he was living in Ingleside, Texas.

Rasmussen's family never heard from him again. Investigators know he was working in Houston, Texas in June 1978, and that same year he called a friend in Arizona and asked to borrow some money. He said he was working on a Texas oil rig at the time.

He surfaced in New Hampshire in 1978 or 1979, using the Bob Evans alias and working as an electrician at the Waumbec Mills in Manchester. He was a skilled electrician and mechanic, but became violent under the influence of alcohol. In 1980, he was arrested in New Hampshire and listed his spouse as Elizabeth Evans, but investigators don't know who that is.

During his time in New Hampshire, Rasmussen lived just a few doors down from Denise Daneault, who disappeared in June 1980. Investigators don't know whether he was involved in her case, but are investigating a possible connection.

Authorities believe Rasmussen was responsible for the murders of a woman and girls whose bodies were found in a wooded area near Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown, New Hampshire.

A hunter found the bodies of the adult woman and one of the children in a 55-gallon metal barrel in 1985. In 2000, authorities found a second barrel nearby with the other two children inside it. All the bodies were wrapped in plastic and electrical wiring. They all died at the same time, probably between 1977 and 1981.

DNA proved two of the girls, the oldest and the youngest, were maternally related to the woman, and isotope tests showed they had all probably had been living in New Hampshire or a nearby state for several years prior to their murders. DNA showed the other girl was Rasmussen's biological daughter, but was unrelated to the woman and the other two girls.

The bodies were all unidentified until 2019, when investigators announced they'd discovered the identity of the woman and her two daughters. The woman was Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch, age 24. Her daughters were Marie Elizabeth Vaughn and Sarah Lynn McWaters.

Photos of Honeychurch and her children are posted with this case summary. They disappeared from Los Angeles County, California in November 1978, at age 24, 7, and 11 months respectively. At the time, Honeychurch was dating Rasmussen.

The third child, Rasmussen's daughter, is still unidentified. A sketch of the victim is posted with this case summary. She was about two to four years old, with wavy brown hair and an overbite that may have been noticeable. Isotope tests indicate she was probably born in a sparsely populated area of the interior western United States or one of the Plains States, and she may have been of Native American ancestry.

Between 1984 and 1986, Rasmussen was living in Los Alamitos and Cypress, California, using the name Curtis Mayo Kimball. (He had stolen the real Curtis Kimball's identity in La Porte, Texas.) He had a five-year-old girl named Lisa, whom he said was his daughter. He said her mother was dead, but gave different accounts as to how she had died.

A woman claims she baby-sat for Lisa and a six-month-old girl in 1984 and 1985, when Rasmussen was living in Anaheim, California; he claimed he was the father of both of them and raising them alone.

Investigators believe Rasmussen may have killed the infant, who has not been identified. In the summer of 1985, he left Lisa in the care of a married couple he knew and dropped out of sight. She was placed in foster care and adopted a short time later. In 1986, felony arrest warrants were issued for Rasmussen under the alias name Gordon Curtis Jenson. He was living in a trailer park in Scotts Valley, California at the time.

In 1988, Rasmussen was arrested in San Luis Obispo, California, under the name Gerald E. Mockerman; police caught him driving a car that had been stolen from Preston, Idaho. Fingerprints identified him as Gordon Jenson and he was charged with child abandonment and child molestation; the victim in both instances was Lisa.

Rasmussen pleaded guilty to abandonment and was sentenced to three years in prison; the molestation charge was dropped because Lisa's adoptive parents didn't want her to have to testify against him in court. He was paroled in 1990 after serving one year, and immediately disappeared again. Investigators have little knowledge of his actions over the next twelve years.

In 2001, Rasmussen married Eunsoon Jun, a Korean immigrant, in Richmond, California, under the name Lawrence William ""Larry"" Vanner. The marriage was not legally binding. A photograph of Jun is posted with this case summary. Within a year he had killed her, partially dismembered her body and buried it under the basement of her home. In 2003, he pleaded guilty to her murder and was sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison. He died there in 2010.

Beginning in 2003, authorities began trying to identify Lisa; they had determined Rasmussen was not her father. In 2014, they entered her DNA into an online database to connect her with her biological relatives. In 2016, the database linked her to a cousin of Denise's, and Lisa was able to confirm that she was Denise Beaudin's daughter and her real name was Dawn. She has no memories of her mother.

It was only after Lisa's identity was confirmed that authorities made the connection between Rasmussen and the four unidentified Allenstown victims. He did some work for the man who owned the land where the unidentified victims were found, and in October 2016, authorities determined he was the biological father of the middle-aged child, the one who wasn't related to the other three victims. They also think he may have killed this child's mother.

Authorities believe Rasmussen probably killed Denise somewhere between New Hampshire and California. She was not listed as a missing person until 2016. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/denise-beaudin,-71.6002223,43.0204052
Pegye Jann Bechler,"July 7, 1997","Newport Beach, California",38,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",130 lbs,"Pegye and her husband, Eric Christopher Bechler, rented an 18-foot powerboat and went for a sail in the Pacific Ocean off Newport Beach, California on July 7, 1997, to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. Photographs of of Eric and the boat are posted with this case summary. He was later found alone, clinging to a body board in the water and screaming for help.

Eric said Pegye had been in the boat and he had been towed behind on the body board when he slipped under the water. When Eric resurfaced, Pegye was no longer in the boat and he assumed she had been swept off by a wave. At the time he was rescued the boat was found nearby, running in circles. Pegye's remains were not recovered, but she was presumed to have drowned.

Eric and Pegye got along well and had three children together, but he drank heavily and was frequently unfaithful. The police were also called to their home twice for domestic disputes; no charges were filed in either incident.

The Bechlers had founded Geri Care Rehabilitation, a retirement services company, and ran it together, but both of them were fired in March 1997 for alleged misconduct and misuse of company funds. The company had made Eric and Pegye very wealthy, but the Bechlers were having financial trouble by 1997 and were also under investigation for alleged Medicare fraud. Eric took out an insurance policy worth over two million dollars on Peggy's life shortly before the boat trip, but was unable to collect on it afterwards.

Although investigators and many people who knew the Bechlers had strong suspicions of murder from the beginning, Eric was not arrested until October 1999. He began dating an actress and bikini model, Tina New, a few months after Pegye disappeared. New was contacted by police and agreed to wear a recording device on her body. While both of them were under the influence of alcohol and the drug Ecstasy, Eric made incriminating statements about Pegye's alleged murder to New. The taped confession led to his arrest and was used against him at his trial.

Prosecutors stated that Eric beat Pegye to death with two 35-pound dumbbells, then tossed her body overboard, weighted by the dumbbells. The dumbbells were missing from the Bechler residence when police searched it. Eric's best friend testified that Eric had planned to kill his wife and dump her body in the ocean. The purpose of her murder was to get life insurance money.

When confronted with the evidence, Eric still maintained that Pegye had drowned in a boating accident. He said he had made up the murder confession to impress New. No traces of Pegye's blood were found on the boat they had rented for the day, which is inconsistent with the statements Eric made to New.

Eric was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. His supporters set up a website proclaiming his innocence; they stated Eric had been unfairly convicted and Pegye may be alive and living in Spain, Australia or Morocco.

Eric remains in prison and all of his appeals have been denied. Pegye's remains have never been found.",http://charleyproject.org/case/pegye-jann-bechler,-117.9444403,33.5940066

On the day of her disappearance, Begay and three friends left their employee housing and went to the no-longer-extant Grand Canyon Inn to have some drinks. She was last seen getting into a vehicle with two unidentified Hopi Indian men. She has never been heard from again.

When Begay didn't return to work, the park authorities fired her and boxed up her belongings. Her family realized she was missing when they came to visit and she was gone. They reported her disappearance to the Navajo Nation authorities, but the Coconino County Sheriff's Office's didn't learn about it for another year.

Although one of Begay's friends at the park thought she might have walked out of her life and didn't want her family to know where she was, the police thought this was unlikely. She was in regular touch with her family while she was working at the park, and had no reason to run away.

Yvonne Katharina Belcher,"December 22, 2000","Green Cove Springs, Florida",25,Caucasian / White,"5'1""",100 lbs,"Belcher was last seen in Green Cove Springs, Florida on December 22, 2000. She and her husband, Jesse A. Owens (nicknamed ""Andy"") resided with his mother on Highland Avenue. The couple argued during the early morning hours and the police were summoned to the house to end the dispute. Owens told authorities that he saw Belcher walk down Highland Avenue at approximately 2:30 a.m. The temperatures were at the freezing mark at the time.

One of Belcher's friends told investigators that he gave her a ride to an undisclosed residence several blocks away from Vermont Street shortly after 2:30 a.m. He said that he waited several minutes for Belcher to return to his car before departing from the house. Another friend reported seeing her walking along Vermont Street towards Florida Route 16 around daybreak. Belcher has never been heard from again.

Owens reported Belcher as a missing person two days after her initial disappearance. He stated that his wife had a history of leaving their home for several days after arguments. Authorities said that Owens and Belcher had a stormy relationship. He was arrested and charged with beating her shortly before their March 2000 wedding.

Officials stated that Owens cooperated with the investigation into Belcher's disappearance and was not considered a suspect. Both he and his wife were arrested on drug and alcohol charges prior to 2000. Owens is now deceased. Authorities searched his home in 2005, but turned up no evidence.

Authorities said that they believed foul play was involved in Belcher's disappearance. Extensive searches of the area produced no clues as to her whereabouts. Investigators received tips that Belcher may have relocated to the Daytona Beach, Florida or Fort Lauderdale, Florida areas to work as a dancer. The leads did not produce any evidence as to her whereabouts. Her family members said that it is uncharacteristic of Belcher to leave for an extended period of time without warning.

Belcher was born in the former West Germany and moved to the United States with her parents during her childhood. She was employed as a dancer in a Jacksonville, Florida establishment and a server in a restaurant at Cattail Creek Golf Club near Florida Route 16 prior to 2000.

Annette Rabino,"January 26, 2000","Pembroke Pines, FL",32,Asian,5'5,115 lbs,"Annette was last seen in Pembroke Pines, Florida on January 26, 2000.

Her common-law husband, Naraine Cyril Ramsammy, did not report her as a missing person for two months. He had various explanations as to Annette's disappearance, claiming she gone to Trinidad to have an abortion, that she was hospitalized after trying to commit suicide by jumping off a cruise ship, or that she had left their home of her own accord.

Annette left behind a young son. Five months after her disappearance, her mother in Guyana received a typewritten letter supposedly from her. The letter stated she had wronged Ramsammy. Its return address was from the same zip code as his home. A photograph of Ramsammy is posted with this case summary.

Annette was previously married to Ramsammy's brother, Sahadeo Kumar, and they had a child together before she moved to the United States.

She and Ramsammy called each other husband and wife, but they were never legally married. Annette was actually married to Darrin Rabino at the time, and she and Darrin had a good relationship. Darrin stated Ramsammy treated Annette badly and was controlling.

Annette disappeared shortly after Ramsammy found out she was having an affair and was pregnant. Ramsammy threatened to kill both her and her lover when he discovered their relationship.

In 2003, Annette and Ramsammy's son stated he saw his father choke his mother until she fell silently to the ground. The boy also claimed the last time he saw Annette was the day after the choking, when she walked out the back door of their home and never returned.

Investigators stated a body located in the Everglades swamp in 2004 may be Annette's. DNA testing to establish the body's identity was inconclusive, but its genetic profile was remarkably similar to Annette's mother and authorities believe she and the victim are biologically related.

Ramsammy was later charged with Annette's murder. At trial, his attorneys argued Annette was still alive and had left on her own. The couple's son testified against his father. Ramsammy was convicted of second-degree murder in March 2008, and sentenced to life in prison.

She lived in a condo on Pleasant Drive in Richton Park, and worked as a secretary for the Cook County State Attorney's Office at the Leighton Criminal Court Building at 26th Street and California Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.

When Bell didn't arrive at work on March 6, the police were sent to her home for a welfare check.

Bell was last seen by her younger sister late in the evening of May 10, 2003, inside their shared apartment in the 800 block of north Randall Road.

Bell apparently wasn't carrying her identification or any money when she disappeared, and authorities believe she intended to return shortly. She never came back inside and has never been heard from again.

The father of Bell's younger child is considered a person of interest in her disappearance and is known to have lied to investigators; he claimed he had not spoken to Bell for two months prior to her disappearance, but her phone records show that they spoke to one another six times on the day Bell went missing. In fact, he is the last person known to have spoken with her. The man had been financially supporting Bell at the time she vanished, as she was unemployed. Authorities obtained a search warrant and drilled holes in the floor of his basement, but they found no evidence in Bell's case, and a cadaver-sniffing dog did not indicate the presence of human remains.

Haleigh Ann Marie Cummings,"February 10, 2009","Satsuma, FL",5,White,"3'0""-3'2""",39 lbs,"Haleigh was last known to be sleeping in her family's trailer in the 200 block of Green Lane in the area of Hermit's Cove in Satsuma, Florida, late in the evening on February 9, 2009. She went to bed at 8:00 p.m. Her father's live-in girlfriend of five months, Misty Janette Croslin (sometimes identified in the media by her later married name, Misty Cummings), went to sleep in the same room at 10:00 p.m. Haleigh's three-year-old brother was also sleeping in that room.

Haleigh's father, Ronald Lemyles Cummings, finished working second shift and arrived home sometime after 3:00 a.m. on February 10. Misty told him she'd just discovered Haleigh was missing from her bed. The rear door to the trailer was several inches ajar and the screen door had been propped open with a cinder block. Ronald and Misty called 911 at 3:37 a.m. to report Haleigh's disappearance.

The police found no sign of forced entry to the trailer, but they are uncertain whether the back door was locked. Ronald and Misty have insisted that it was, and Ronald maintains the trailer was broken into.

Haleigh's younger brother told investigators that a man dressed in black had come to their home that night and taken his sister. Authorities aren't sure how much credence to give to his story, given his age. An extensive search of the area turned up no sign of Haleigh. Her father stated she wouldn't have left home by herself at night, as she is afraid of the dark.

Initial reports were that Haleigh was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear, but police later said they'd found the shirt. They wouldn't say where, but Misty says she found it in the laundry pile after she was allowed back into the house. Investigators now say they don't know what Haleigh was wearing the night of her disappearance.

Photos of Ronald and Misty are posted with this case summary. They got married in March, a month after Haleigh's disappearance. Ronald stated he thought Haleigh would have wanted it. They needed to get permission from Misty's parents, as she was only seventeen years old.

In October 2009, six months into the marriage, Ronald filed for divorce. He cited irreconcilable differences as the reason, mainly the stress caused by Haleigh's disappearance and the subsequent police investigation and media attention. The divorce became final within days; since Ronald and Misty had only been married a short time and they didn't share any property or have any children together, there was little to discuss.

Haleigh visited her biological mother, Crystal Sheffield, every other weekend. A photo of Sheffield is posted with this case summary. She and Ronald, who never married, separated four years before Haleigh disappeared and fought over custody of their two children in court. Ronald wanted custody because Sheffield had admitted to using cocaine and because Haleigh had missed several doctor's appointments while in her care. Sheffield alleged Ronald was violent. She once sought a protective order against him, but the case was dismissed.

Ronald was given full custody of both children in December 2005. He had minor brushes with the law, mainly drug arrests, prior to Haleigh's disappearance, but in most cases the charges were dropped or he got deferred adjudication.

Both Sheffield and Ronald retained attorneys after Haleigh's disappearance. Through her attorney, Sheffield accused Ronald of child abuse and neglect. Both sides' attorneys have since withdrawn their representation. Police also questioned Sheffield's fiance as well as other family members, friends of the family, and neighbors.

Police repeatedly questioned Misty about Haleigh's disappearance and looked into the possibility that she wasn't in fact at home when the child disappeared. Misty describes herself as a devoted caregiver to Haleigh and her brother and said she had been home the entire night and hadn't left the children alone.

Investigators have been publicly skeptical of Misty's story, stating she failed four polygraphs and one voice stress test, and changed her story multiple times; they described her accounts as ""consistently inconsistent.""

Misty and her older brother, Hank Thomas ""Tommy"" Croslin Jr., later accused Joseph ""Joe"" Overstreet of kidnapping Haleigh. Overstreet, who is from Tennessee, was in Florida when the child disappeared. He visited the Cummings home on February 9 and left only a few hours before Haleigh vanished. The next day he returned to Tennessee. Photos of Overstreet and Tommy are posted with this case summary. Misty stated Overstreet had sexually abused her when she was a child and had been involved in criminal activity his whole life, although he is not registered as a sex offender.

Tommy was the first to accuse Overstreet of kidnapping, stating Overstreet planned to steal a machine gun from the Cummings residence and, when he couldn't find it, he threatened Misty with a knife and took Haleigh. Overstreet and Tommy drove to the St. Johns River, five miles from Haleigh's home, and Overstreet threw the child in the water. Misty later affirmed his statement, saying she had lied earlier because she was afraid of her cousin.

Overstreet denies any involvement in Haleigh's disappearance and he hasn't been charged in connection with it or even named as a suspect, although he has been interviewed. Authorities searched the river in April 2010 and brought Misty to the dock, but the search yielded nothing of interest.

Misty, Tommy and Ronald were arrested on unrelated drug trafficking charges in January 2010, along with Ronald's cousin, Hope Antwanette Sykes, and a friend, Donna Michelle Brock. Sykes, Tommy, Ronald and Brock all pleaded guilty, and Misty pleaded no contest. ll the defendants except Misty were sentenced to fifteen years in prison; Misty got twenty-five years.

Misty and Tommy's parents, Hank and Lisa Croslin, were also jailed on drug charges, albeit ones unrelated to their children's drug case, in the summer of 2010. They have since been released. Overstreet also is facing drug charges in Tennessee.

Haleigh's favorite food is macaroni and cheese, and her favorite things to play with are makeup and her laptop computer. At the time of her disappearance, she was a kindergarten student at Browning Pearce Elementary School in San Mateo, Florida. Her case remains unsolved and is classified as a homicide.

Susan Robin Bender,"Aprill 25, 1986","Modesto, California",15,"Native American, Hispanic/Latina, White/Caucasian","5'5""",130 lbs,"Susan left her family's home in Modesto, California on April 25, 1986 to stay with friends in Carmel, California. She was last seen at the former Greyhound bus depot on 10th Street and G Street in Modesto, making a phone call. Susan did not board a bus; instead, she was seen entering an unidentified full-sized olive-green 1977 Ford van outside of the station during the day. Susan has never been seen again.

Susan's diary, address book and some items of her clothing were located at a suspect's home after she vanished. The person was questioned by investigators, but released due to a lack of evidence.

Wesley Howard Shermantine Jr. and Loren Joseph Herzog, the so-called ""Speed Freak Killers,"" are possible suspects in Susan's case. They were arrested in 2000 and ultimately convicted of murdering several females in the 1980s and 1990s; authorities believe they had as many as fifteen victims. Photographs of both men are posted with this case summary.

Shermantine is on death row. Herzog's sentence was reduced from 78 years to 14 years after the court ruled his confession had been coerced. He was paroled in 2010 and then took his own life in January 2012, after he found out his former partner had begun cooperating with authorities and had offered to reveal the location of victims' bodies in exchange for a payment of $33,000.

Shermantine led investigators to the skeletal remains of Chevelle Wheeler and Cyndi Vanderheiden, who'd been missing since 1985 and 1998 respectively. He also pointed out an abandoned well in Linden, California that contained some 300 human bones and personal items. Shermantine stated the well contains up to twenty victims. He blames Herzog for all the murders and says he only helped with disposing the bodies. Authorities are in the process of sorting out the contents of the well and attempting to identify the bones.

Shermantine and Herzog are being investigated in other missing persons' cases, including Phillip Martin, Michaela Garecht, Sylvia Standly, Gayle Marks and Ruth Leamon. Victims Kimberly Billy, a 19-year-old who disappeared in 1984, and Joann Hobson, a 16-year-old who disappeared in 1985, have already been identified.

Foul play is suspected in Susan's case; it remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/susan-robin-bender,-120.996846,37.6376274

In 2011, while looking for evidence in Bennett's case, police searched the former property of a Pine Bluff man who died in December 2010. His ex-wife told police he'd admitted to having killed a woman named ""Show-Do."" This was Bennett's nickname. He supposedly buried her body under an outhouse on his property in the 10200 block of Princeton Pike Road in Pine Bluff. The police looked at the property but did not dig, and they found no evidence of human remains.

Her husband, Robert Eugene ""Bob"" Bennett, said she failed to return home from a shopping trip. She has never been heard from again. The contents of her home and most of a $90,000 inheritance disappeared with her.

Bob said he thought Floy had run off with another man. He stated that five days after her disappearance, her rental car was found parked in the driveway when he got home, and some clothes and suitcases were missing, but there was no sign of Floy. Two weeks after her disappearance, he filed for divorce. In 1986, he married to his brother's widow.

In 1989, Bob pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the shooting death and dismemberment of a friend and occasional chess companion who lived in Salt Lake City, Utah. His victim disappeared in February that year, and the next day his severed legs were found in a trash bin. In May, the man's head and torso were found buried at a home Bob had previously rented. The murder was not related to Floy's disappearance and Bob has not been named as a suspect in her case.

She'd been trying to find a ride for hours. She got into the car and has never been heard from again.

The man who picked up Bianco is described as Caucasian, with short black hair that covered his ears. He had an unshaven face and a small build, and the paint job on his car was faded. Prior to her disappearance, Bianco hadn't indicated she was being stalked or was having problems with anyone. She was close to her adult son and called him multiple times a day; it would be uncharacteristic of her to abandon her.

On January 27, 2008, she and a female coworker went to Panama City Beach, Florida on business. They checked into rooms at the La Quinta Inn on Thomas Drive.

Biggers went to her room at 7:00 p.m. She was discovered missing at 6:00 a.m. the next day. Her bed didn't appear to have been slept in; it looked as if she had been reading in it. There were pillows propped against the headboard, and an open book and Biggers's reading glasses were on the bedside table.

There were no signs of a struggle. A night clerk was stationed less than 100 feet from Biggers's room, but no one saw her leave. She left behind all her belongings, including her purse, money, keys, identification, clothes, cellular phone and car.

The day of her disappearance, Biggers was acting strangely; she began hearing voices and appeared to be having conversations with people who weren't there. She was under stress because her son, a soldier, was about to be deployed to Afghanistan. Her son was stationed in Jacksonville, North Carolina in January 2008 and it's possible Biggers tried to go there to see him. There were leads placing her in the Mansfield, Ohio area months after her disappearance, but none of the accounts were confirmed.

It's possible that Biggers developed amnesia and wandered away from the hotel in a confused condition. She has no prior history of memory loss or going missing. Foul play is not suspected in her case, but due to her mental condition, there is grave concern for her safety.

Acacia Patience Bishop,"May 25, 2003","Salt Lake City, Utah",1,Caucasian / White,"2'6""",30 lbs,"Acacia was abducted by her grandmother, 38-year-old Kelley Jean Lodmell, from her great-grandparents' Salt Lake City, Utah home at 6:00 p.m. on May 25, 2003. Photographs of Lodmell and her car are posted with this case summary. She had previously taken Acacia without permission and hid her in a basement, and she was on supervised visitation with the baby when she abducted her in May 2003. They escaped when the supervisor, Acacia's great-grandmother, left the room for a moment.

Acacia and Lodmell were last seen together in Idaho Falls, Idaho on May 26, close to the Broadway overpass and green belt, next to the Snake River.

That same day, Lodmell went to a hydroelectric plant near the overpass and told employees there that she had dropped Acacia into the river while they were dangling their feet off the bridge. The plant was immediately shut down so Acacia would not get sucked into its turbines.

Divers searched the murky river for several days, but Acacia was not found there. However, a pair of baby shoes and a doll were found on the riverbank. One of Lodmell's shoes was also found on the bank; the other one was in the water.

Authorities believe Acacia drowned in the Snake River; they have classified her case as a homicide. They do not feel that Acacia accidentally fell into the river.

Lodmell was soaking wet when she ran to the power plant for help, and the police believe she intentionally jumped in the water with Acacia in her arms in a murder/suicide attempt. She admitted this to authorities and was charged with kidnapping and murdering Acacia. She stated that she believed the baby made it out of the water and is still alive somewhere.

Lodmell has a criminal record; she has been charged with many petty offenses including drunk driving, threats with a dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct. Her most serious offense was aggravated assault; she served sixty days in jail for shooting a child with a pellet gun.

She has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and has a history of substance abuse as well. She has occasionally lived on the streets or in her car, and she took her medication only when she could afford to pay for it. She was not taking it at the time she abducted Acacia.

Acacia's parents hope that Lodmell is lying about her granddaughter's presumed death in an effort to conceal her from the rest of the family, and that she possibly passed Acacia over to one of her friends and would find her after she was released from prison. She had reportedly always been possessive of the child.

Acacia's parents say Lodmell has never had suicidal tendencies before, and had never indicated that she might harm Acacia. They characterize Lodmell as a habitual liar and suggested her confession of murder was a fabrication, and that she had been planning Acacia's abduction for months.

Acacia's parents claim Lodmell sent them a letter from jail, writing that Acacia was alive and being cared for by others. She never referred to Acacia in the past tense in her letters. They also point out that Lodmell purchased diapers and milk for Acacia shortly before the baby allegedly drowned, which would not make sense if she had been planning to murder her.

Police investigated the possibility that Lodmell gave or sold Acacia to other individuals, but they could find no evidence to support this theory. Nevertheless, her parents are convinced she is still alive.

Acacia's mother and father are offering a reward for their daughter's safe return. They have issued a sketch of a man they think may be helping hide Acacia. The sketch was not made by a professional sketch artist and is not endorsed by the police. It is posted with this case summary.

The man was allegedly seen checking Lodmell and Acacia out of the Red Lion Hotel on May 26. He was described as being in his late forties or early fifties with rough, weathered tan skin, graying sunbleached hair, hazel eyes, large hands with carrot-shaped fingers, and a small build. He was about 5'6 tall and smoked Basics cigarettes. Police detectives do not think the man, if he exists, was involved in Acacia's disappearance and presumed death.

Lodmell was tried for kidnapping in federal court. In January 2005, a judge acquitted her, ruling that she was insane at the time of her crime. The judge decided Lodmell was delusional when she abducted Acacia and believed the baby was in an abusive situation and she had a duty to save her.

Lodmell was determined to be a danger to the community, based on her mental illness, past criminal behavior, and history of violence and substance abuse. She was committed to a mental hospital for an indefinite period. She may be released from the hospital at a later date if psychiatrists determine she is no longer dangerous, but her prognosis is poor, as she has repeatedly refused to follow through with treatment programs for her schizophrenia and does not even believe she is mentally ill.

It is unlikely that Lodmell will ever be released from federal custody; therefore, Idaho prosecutors dropped the murder and kidnapping charges against her. If she ever is released from the hospital, she may face the state charges again.

At the time of her disappearance, Acacia she was able to walk, run, and say one-syllable words. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/acacia-patience-bishop,-112.0444302,43.493266

She and her two brothers-in-law, Rick Ross and Sam Pavala, were bringing donated food from the Platinum fish processing plant twelve miles to their village, in a flat-bottomed 20-foot boat with an inboard V-8 motor, when the boat sank in the bay.

One of the men called for help on a cellular phone as the boat was going down and a search was launched. Rescuers found Ross and Pavala's bodies in the water, but were unable to locate Chingliak.

The vessel was probably not overloaded, but it was designed for river travel, not ocean travel, and had low sides. There was a strong west wind that day, and this combined with the outgoing tide may have created rough water in the bay and swamped the boat. It was later found sunk in ten feet of water about four miles from Platinum.

Christine Blackburn-Wiles,"April 21, 2007","Belleview, Florida",39,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",160 lbs,"Blackburn-Wiles was last seen in Belleview, Florida at 1:00 a.m. on April 21, 2007. She and her sister went to some bars that day. Billy Joe Ashton Sr., Blackburn-Wiles's boyfriend, followed them. Blackburn-Wiles asked her sister to pull over, and got into the 1995 Chrysler New Yorker Ashton was driving. Photographs of the vehicle are posted with this case summary.

Ashton later claimed they had an argument and he dropped her off around the corner from where her estranged husband lived. Her husband denied having seen her, however. Blackburn-Wiles has never been heard from again.

Her family initially thought she had gone to Texas. She was reported missing in early May, after she failed to get in touch with her daughter on the girl's sixteenth birthday. Blackburn-Wiles has a drinking problem, but it's uncharacteristic of her not to contact her child.

On July 24, the vehicle Blackburn-Wiles was last seen in was found at Wildcat Lake in Lake County, Florida, near the home of one of Ashton's relatives. Her blood was in the trunk. A witness told police that Ashton burned some items from the trunk of the Chrysler. Investigators went to the spot of the fire and dug it up, and found some fragments of clothing, including buttons from a pair of Faded Glory jeans. Blackburn-Wiles often wore that brand.

Ashton was incarcerated shortly after Blackburn-Wiles's disappearance. Some of her missing persons posters were displayed in the jail and he tore them down. He reportedly told an informant at the jail that he had elbowed Blackburn-Wiles in the face and knocked her out, and he wiped up her blood with a towel which he put in the trunk, and this was how the blood had gotten there. He also stated he had ""gotten rid"" of her.

A photo of Ashton is posted with this case summary. He has a history of violent behavior and served six years in prison for kidnapping and assaulting another girlfriend in 1998. In June 2010, he was sentenced to thirty years in prison for possession of a firearm by a habitual offender. Less than 24 hours later, he was charged with second-degree murder in Blackburn-Wiles's case.

Authorities stated the evidence against him was largely circumstantial and included tips from informants, DNA analysis and witness statements. However, in February 2013, the case against him was dropped due to insufficient proof. Charges may be refiled against Ashton if more evidence surfaces. He is still incarcerated for the weapons offense.

Jean Gertrude Block,"July 4, 1977","Utica, Michigan",58,Caucasian / White,"4'9"" - 4'11""
",160 lbs - 170 lbs,"Jean and her husband, John, were last seen in Utica, Michigan on July 4, 1977. They took off from Macomb Airport at 11:10 a.m. in their green and white two-seater, single-engine Cessna airplane with the Michigan tag number N 50935. A photo of the plane is posted with this case summary.

The couple planned to visit their son in northern Michigan to celebrate Independence Day together. Their destination was Lost Creek Sky Ranch Airport in Luzerne, Michigan. John is a veteran pilot with thirty years' experience.

The Blocks never arrived at the airport and have never been heard from again. They didn't file a flight plan before leaving the Macomb Airport. They would have normally flown over northbound Interstate 75, but the weather that day was poor and John, who had no instruments on his plane and navigated using visual guidelines only, may have mistaken Interstate 69 for Interstate 75 in the Flint, Michigan area, which would have placed them near Lansing, Michigan.

A pilot believes he encountered the couple at an airstrip in Charlotte, Michigan, southwest of Lansing; he stated they took off shortly after noon, heading north. They left the airstrip without refueling because the airport was closed.

An extensive search turned up no sign of John or Jean Block or their plane. North central Michigan, where the search was centered, is heavily wooded and the foliage may have concealed the wreckage of the plane. The couple has never been found.

Edna Laverne Blodgett,"June 2, 1993","Post, Texas",75,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",121 lbs,"Blodgett resided in Post, Texas in 1993. She lived with her boyfriend, Jerry T. Smith, before receiving an order of protection against him that year. Witnesses said that Smith physically abused Blodgett on several occasions. He continued to visit her at her house regardless of the orders against him.

Blodgett was last seen near her residence on June 2, 1993. A witness told authorities that she was seen walking along a dirt road off of U.S. Highway 84 northwest of Post later during the day. She has never been heard from again.

Several unconfirmed sightings of her in the area afterwards included one account of an elderly woman fitting her description who appeared unkempt and had a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. The unidentified woman claimed that she was traveling to Amarillo, Texas. It is not known if the individual was Blodgett.

Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation employees were unable to locate Blodgett and reported her as a missing person on June 14, 1993. Her family members said that it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Blodgett normally tended her garden at home and also walked to several local businesses on a daily basis. No one recalled seeing Blodgett after June 2.

Smith was charged with forgery after he attempted to cash a $100 check from Blodgett's bank account later in June 1993. He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to ten years in prison. Authorities charged Smith with Blodgett's homicide later in 1995. A witness testified that Smith told him he murdered Blodgett in Texas, then departed for a short trip to Arkansas in early June 1993.

The witness claimed that Smith said he buried her body in a 55-gallon drum, then packed soil around the container. The individual stated that Smith poured high-octane gasoline over the drum and ignited it, claiming he believed the process would destroy Blodgett's bones and any evidence of her murder.

Smith had a history of abuse prior to his relationship with Blodgett. His former wife told authorities that she filed for divorce in the early 1980s after Smith beat her severely. He pleaded guilty to assaulting his father in 1985. He was convicted of Blodgett's murder in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison. He continued to maintain his innocence throughout his trial.

Blodgett's former home was damaged during a fire in January 2000, nearly seven years after her disappearance. A construction worker discovered a bone fragment among the debris during the cleaning process later that summer. Some people speculated that the fragment was part of Blodgett's remains, but investigators stated that it was likely an animal bone.

Blodgett's body has never been recovered.",http://charleyproject.org/case/edna-laverne-blodgett,-101.4269463,33.2167809
Heather Bloom,"October 1, 2005","Berkeley, California",28,Caucasian / White,"5'0"" - 5'7""
",140 lbs - 160 lbs,"Heather was last seen in Berkeley, California on October 1, 2005, when the police were called to an apartment at Carleton and California streets to intervene in an argument between Heather's mother, Phyllis, and her sister, Shari. Heather was present at the time; she and her mother were visiting Shari from Brooklyn, New York.

The argument was resolved and the police left. When Phyllis returned to New York, she left Heather in Shari's care. The sisters lived in an apartment in the 1600 block of Parker Street. This was the last time the police or Heather's mother ever saw her.

Phyllis contacted the police in June 2009 and said she hadn't heard from either Heather or Shari since the argument in 2005. She asked authorities to check on Heather's welfare.

Shari had moved away from the Parker Street apartment in 2007, and it took months before law enforcement was able to find her. The police went to Shari's new apartment in March 2010 and she wouldn't open the door for them. She answered questions through the window and said Heather was fine, but she refused to let anyone see Heather or come inside the home.

Shari's neighbors at her new residence reported that they never saw Heather. Within a month, she had moved again and police lost track of her. Her landlord had evicted her because she owed thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars in back rent.

Authorities subsequently learned that Shari moved to Norway on a student visa in approximately 2016. The local media in Berkeley reached out to her by email and phone, but never heard back, and attempts to locate Heather have remained unsuccessful.

The police are uncertain what happened to Heather and don't necessarily believe she's deceased or in danger, but they need to be able to see her and confirm her well-being to close her missing persons case. It's possible her sister placed her in a care home or with another caregiver in the San Francisco Bay area. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/heather-bloom,-122.273042,37.8715226

She said she was cleaning out her kitchen cabinets. She has never been heard from again.

When her nephew checked her house, the front door was wide open and Blount's phone was lying on the floor with the battery pulled out. Pots were stacked on the kitchen floor and valuables were left out in plain view; it didn't appear that there had been a robbery.

Her silver four-door 2006 Toyota Camry was found parked in an abandoned about a quarter of a mile from her home at 4:15 p.m. the day of her disappearance. It had been was parked on a dirt logging road on the property of a hunting club, 25 or 30 yards off the main road and out of sight, hidden by trees. There was water on the floor of the vehicle, possibly from the heavy rains that had occurred in the area.

Blount is a widow and lived alone at the time of her disappearance, but she kept in regular touch with her relatives and her disappearance is out of character. Her two children lived on the same road as herself, and she still cooked dinner for them ever day, as well as driving her sister to medical appointments. She lived quietly and was active in her local Baptist church.

Blount is described as a cautious individual who didn't open her door to strangers and carried a gun when she went outside to milk the cows. Her credit cards haven't been used since she went missing.

She had gone to visit a friend, Brian Biddle, at his home, taking only her laptop and possibly some extra clothing. The friend said they were drinking and partying and Klus was acting normally.

About a day and a half after she left, just after dawn, Klus repeatedly texted another friend asking to be picked up. Her friend didn't see the messages until twenty minutes later. He texted and called her, but she never responded. Biddle said he went to sleep for eighteen hours and when he woke up, she was gone.

On December 11, a 911 call was made on her phone, but the caller hung up without speaking a word, and it's unclear whether the called was Klus. The 911 call pinged off a phone tower at the 86-acre Mallard Lake Forest Preserve, twenty miles from Biddle's house and eighteen miles from Klus's house. Multiple searches of the preserve turned up no sign of her.

It's not uncharacteristic of Klus to drop out of sight for a few days or a week at a time, but she's never been gone for this long. Her loved ones stated she was depressed over her mother's death at the time of her disappearance. The circumstances of her disappearance are unclear and her case remains unsolved.

She said she would be back, but didn't say where she was going. Bolanos-Rivera never returned home and has never been heard from again.

She left behind all her belongings, including her wallet and medication, taking only her cellular phone. Her six children stated she's a good mother who wouldn't have abandoned them.

Investigators stated they thought Bolanos-Rivera was in the company of Eloy Vasquez-Santiago, a coworker of hers who disappeared at the same time she did. They had been romantically involved, although Vasquez-Santiago also had a common-law wife and child. In late September, he was arrested in California and charged with Bolanos-Rivera's murder.

A photo of Vasquez-Santiago is posted with this case summary. He confessed to the crime, saying he'd stabbed Bolanos-Rivera after they took a trip into the mountains together and got into an argument over money. Vasquez-Santiago stated he dumped her body near Hagg Lake, then fled to Mexico. He was arrested about a month later after he decided to return to the United States and turn himself in to police.

Vasquez-Santiago told authorities he killed Bolanos-Rivera after she insulted him. Investigators searched the Hagg Lake area for Bolanos-Rivera's body, but found nothing of interest.

Vasquez-Santiago's father and brother were also charged with hindering prosecution, for helping Vasquez-Santiago evade police after Bolanos-Rivera's disappearance. The charges were dropped in May 2014; by then, they'd been in custody for a year and a half. They remained in jail on material witness warrants, however. A material witness warrant allows authorities to hold someone in jail for an indefinite period without charging them with a crime, if their testimony is crucial in a criminal trial and they're unlikely to make themselves available to testify.

Vasquez-Santiago's brother was held for 727 days until he agreed to give a deposition on video; their father refused to do so and was held for 905 days until he testified at the trial. Vasquez-Santiago was convicted of murder in March 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.

Bolanos-Rivera has never been found, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/maria-senorina-bolanos-rivera,-122.9367075,45.5199113

",120 lbs - 130 lbs,"Boomer attended a barbecue at Prospect Park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn with a friend on August 15, 2015. Afterwards, they went to her friend's home in the Red Hook housing projects in the 400 block of Columbia Street.

Boomer wanted to go to another barbecue, but her friend wanted to stay home, so Boomer left alone at 11:00 p.m. She never arrived at the barbecue. She did call her sister at 3:00 a.m. on August 16, but her sister was asleep and didn't pick up the phone, and Boomer didn't leave a message. She has never been heard from again.

Her mother, whom she lived with in the Sheepshead Bay area, was initially unconcerned because she'd stayed out all night before. After Boomer didn't come home two nights in a row and didn't get in touch with her sister for her sister's August 18 birthday, her family became concerned and reported her missing.

At the time of her disappearance, Aliyah was studying nursing at college. Her family doesn't believe she would have left without warning. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/aliyah-boomer,-74.005956,40.6781133
Mimi Boomhower,"August 18, 1949","Los Angeles, California",48,Caucasian / White,,,"Boomhower was last heard from when she spoke to a friend by telephone from her home in the 700 block of Nimes Road in Los Angeles, California on August 18, 1949. The friend called her between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. After the conversation was over, Boomhower changed clothes, leaving the old dress on her bed, and left her home.

She left her 1941 sedan locked and parked in the garage, an uneaten salad on the dining room table, and all the lights turned on. She has never been heard from again. She had many social engagements scheduled for the week of her disappearance and missed them all without notifying anyone, which is uncharacteristic of her.

Prior to her disappearance, Boomhower had told a friend she couldn't come over for dinner on the night of the 18th because ""something has come up,"" and she told her business manager she was going to meet a man that night. She didn't say who she was meeting, or where, or why.

Investigators determined she had probably disappeared sometime between 8:00 and 8:45 p.m. Her conversation with her friend was over at 8:00, and she had promised to call her business manager at 8:30, but never did. Because she lived alone and her friends initially thought she'd just left on a trip, her disappearance wasn't reported for several days.

According to Boomhower's gardener, for about a week prior to her disappearance, a middle-aged man with white hair sat in an expensive car in the next driveway and watched her house. This man has never been identified and it's unclear whether he had anything to do with her case.

A few days before she went missing, Boomhower spoke to her furrier and said she couldn't place an order yet because she had to discuss it with her husband. She then corrected herself and said she needed to discuss it with her family. Her furrier found these comments strange, because Boomhower's husband had been dead for years and her closest relative was a sister who lived in New York.

Investigators looked into the theory that Boomhower had eloped, but they could find no evidence to support it; she didn't seem interested in getting remarried and none of her family or friends thought she would have left without telling anyone.

Boomhower's white calfskin handbag was found in a telephone booth at a supermarket on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles on August 25, a week after she disappeared. On the side of the purse someone had written a message in ink: ""Police Dept. - we found this at beach Thursday night."" Thursday was the day of Boomhower's disappearance.

The purse contained a credit card, Boomhower's driver's license, her car and house keys, her compact and her lipstick. There no evidence that the purse had been exposed to sand or water. This was the last known trace of Boomhower.

Boomhower disappeared the day before the sixth anniversary of the death of her husband, a linoleum tycoon and big game hunter. Because of the timing, authorities looked into the possibility that she had taken her own life. They could find no evidence to support this theory.

Boomhower is described as a very social, fun-loving woman. She gave the appearance of a wealthy individual, but in fact she was having financial problems at the time of her disappearance. She had pawned her watch, was considering pawning some jewelry, and was trying to sell her furniture and late husband's big game trophies at a fraction of their value. She'd also taken out a $5,000 home equity loan and additional loans. She had put her house on the market earlier that year and was willing to sell it at a loss. However, her attorney stated she was not bankrupt and she was not depressed about her financial issues.

A judge declared Boomhower legally dead just eleven days after her disappearance; California state law usually required a person to be missing at least ninety days, but judge waived this rule so Boomhower's attorney could administer her estate.

In November 1949, however, the judge reversed his ruling. Boomhower was eventually declared legally dead a second time seven years after her disappearance; by then, debts and legal fees had reduced her estate's value by more than two-thirds.

Investigators believe Boomhower was murdered, but no suspects have ever been named in her case and the circumstances surrounding her disappearance are unclear.",http://charleyproject.org/case/mimi-boomhower,-118.2905352,34.0683828
Margie Shaw Boone,"November 4, 1995","Sanford, North Carolina",66,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",160 lbs,"Boone was last seen in Sanford, North Carolina on November 4, 1995. She visited the home of her boyfriend, Hoyle Smith, during the day. Neither of them has been heard from again.

Authorities discovered a trail of blood inside Smith's house shortly after he and Boone were reported missing. There was no other sign of the couple at the scene, although the home appeared to have been burglarized.

Donald Abercrombie held officers at bay during a 17-hour standoff in Fayetteville, North Carolina on November 9, five days after Smith and Boone disappeared. A photo of Abercrombie is posted with this case summary. He eventually surrendered to investigators and pled guilty to the incident. Abercrombie was sentenced to 25 to 30 months in prison.

Authorities determined that DNA evidence inside Smith's home linked Abercrombie to the scene of the presumed murders. He was charged with one count of robbery and two counts of first-degree murder. Investigators said that Abercrombie confessed to Smith and Boone's homicides and claimed that he buried the couple in the woods near his residence in Spring Lake, North Carolina.

A jury convicted Abercrombie of both murders in February 1997. He was sentenced to two life terms in prison, although prosecutors had requested the death penalty. Several of Abercrombie's family members testified that he was abused as a child and was severely affected by his father's death several years earlier.

She went out with friends and never arrived back home. About a week later, her red 1997 Lincoln Continental was found parked in the back lot outside a shopping center at Gaslight Square in Edenton; the doors were locked and the keys were missing.

Thomas Edward White Sr. is a person of interest in Bosta's disappearance.

Mary Lou Boston,"September 1, 1968","Sacramento, California",23,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",120 lbs,"Mary was last seen in Sacramento, California on September 1, 1968. She has never been heard from again. Her brother reported her missing; he stated in the police report that Mary's disappearance was extremely uncharacteristic, as she was a devoted mother to her three children and wouldn't have abandoned them.

Mary was married to Silas Duane Boston at the time of her disappearance. Her brother stated Silas acted ""nervous and jittery"" when Mary disappeared, didn't report his wife missing and said he didn't want to get involved. Mary's brother also noted that a .22 caliber rifle, one of Silas's prized possessions, was missing. Silas said he had traded the rifle for some items he wanted.

In December 2016, at the age of 75, Silas was charged in a double homicide committed at sea in 1978. Federal agents were investigating him as a suspect in Mary's disappearance when one of Silas's sons told them that as a thirteen-year-old, he'd witnessed his father murder two British tourists and throw them overboard in the Caribbean Sea. The bodies of Dr. Christopher Farmer and his girlfriend, Peta Frampton, were found in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Guatemala on July 8, 1978.

Silas allegedly bragged to others about shooting Mary to death and burying her body at an undisclosed location. He told one traveling partner that he'd shot Mary twice as she begged for her life, then buried her body near a remote creek in nothern California. He told the same person that he'd killed two tourists in Belize and three drug dealers in Sacramento. He may have also been involved in a hit-and-run homicide in Sacramento in 1972.

Silas never faced trial for Farmer and Frampton's murders or any other cases; he died of natural causes in April 2017. Foul play is suspected in Mary's case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/mary-lou-boston,-121.4946142,38.5820751
Mary Lou BostwickÊ Ê*,"July 17, 1972","Waverly, New York",15,White/Caucasian,"5' 2""",120 lbs,"Mary Lou was last seen on July 17, 1972, three days before her sixteenth birthday. Her father dropped her off at a friend's apartment on Broad Street in Waverly, New York; she was supposed to baby-sit there. Three days later, Mary Lou's mother went to the house with her daughter's birthday cake and gifts, and the occupants said Mary Lou had never arrived there to baby-sit. However, her belongings were there, including the change of clothes she'd carried in a grocery bag.

Mary Lou has never been heard from again. Although she had stayed overnight with relatives and friends before, she had never run away and her family thinks she would have contacted them if she could have. She attended Athens High School, but her parents had agreed to let her drop out of school after her birthday in order to take care of her younger siblings.

Another local girl, sixteen-year-old Sharron Coston, disappeared from Sayre, Pennsylvania in October 1973. Her body was found a few days later; she'd been strangled and her body mutilated. Gerard Paul McKenna was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death in 1974. Although he maintained his innocence, he asked to be executed because he didn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison. In 1982 his conviction was overturned on appeal, and by the time he was convicted a second time the death penalty had been outlawed in Pennsylvania. He has since died in prison.

Mary Lou's mother believes Sharron's murder and her daughter's disappearance are related. One of the witnesses who testified against McKenna in exchange for immunity from prosecution is a suspect in Mary Lou's case. One person claimed later that Mary Lou had been beaten to death during a party at a home in Sayre, but he was unable to substantiate the story.

When Mary Lou's brother died in 2004, she was listed in his obituary as having pre-deceased him. Her mother, two other brothers and her sister are still alive.

The vehicle in which the Boyds and McCord were traveling was located disabled and abandoned in Dorchester County near the intersection of Highway 15 and 176 on April 5. McCord's husband found it. A freeze plug had blown out and the engine had overheated. There was no sign of the three females at the scene and they have never been heard from again.

Sarah's credit card was used in a local mall in 1990, three years after her disappearance. Police stated the signature was barely legible and didn't match Sarah's writing. The identity of the credit card user has never been established. Foul play is suspected in McCord and the Boyds' disappearances.

Jackie's nine-year-old brother was asleep in the room at the time of her disappearance and didn't see or hear anything, but he was a very sound sleeper. Besides the pink nightgown Jackie was wearing, $7 in cash, a maroon nylon ski jacket and blue jogging shoes were the only things that were missing from her room.

Jackie didn't have a boyfriend at the time of her disappearance and wasn't having any problems in her life. She was a sixth-grader at Starr School in 1980. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/jackie-kay-boyer,-122.8163802,38.5471327
Andrea Nicole Boyette,"December 23, 1994","Lakeland, Florida",26,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",120 lbs,"Andrea Boyette was last seen in Lakeland, Florida on December 23, 1994. Her family members told authorities that she appeared to be distraught during the day of her disappearance.

She had been married to John Edward ""Johnny"" Boyette for three months at the time. Andrea told her relatives that her marriage was troubled. She wanted someone to accompany her when she picked up John after his work shift ended, but her loved ones were unable to make the trip.

John told investigators that he and Andrea visited several bars along Cypress Gardens Boulevard in Winter Haven, Florida during the evening. He claimed that they returned to their rented house on Eastway Drive in Lakeland later that night. John stated that Andrea disappeared from their home while he was in the bathroom. Her three children, all of whom who were home on the evening of her disappearance, all contradicted this statement.

Andrea has never been heard from again. Her grandmother reported her as a missing person on March 3, 1995, over two months after she disappeared.

John claimed that he discovered Andrea's jewelry near their family's vehicle outside of their residence. Another relative said that the items were located on the front porch shortly afterwards. John apparently sold the majority of Andrea's valuables to local pawn shops, as his name was listed on the merchandise's receipts. He abandoned her children at their babysitter's home.

John allegedly told a friend that he ran over Andrea with their car on the night of her disappearance. The statement has never been verified. John has a criminal record which includes charges of battery and domestic battery. He remarried after Andrea's disappearance and had a child.

In February 2004, Andrea's son from a prior relationship, Dustin Cunningham, told investigators he had witnessed her murder in 1994. He was nine years old at the time. He stated that he saw John choke Andrea outside their home until she vomited, then he drove away with her and came back without her. Cunningham stated that John made him and his siblings clean up the vomit in the car.

In June 2004, John's brother, Robert Boyette, confessed that he helped John dispose of Andrea's remains. He said they were weighted with chains and blocks and dumped in an artificial lake at the Noralyn Mine, a phosphate mine in Bartow, Florida. John worked at the mine at the time Andrea disappeared. The lake has since been filled in with tons of dirt and authorities do not believe they can find Andrea's body.

In August 2004, a grand jury indicted John for second-degree murder in connection with Andrea's case. His trial was scheduled to begin in May 2006, but days before jury selection commenced, John took a plea deal instead of going to trial. He pleaded no contest to manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in prison. John was paroled in October 2009.

A felony warrant for child custody deprivation was issued for her on on March 27, 2006, and an FBI warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was issued for her on May 15, 2006.

Uchiyama and Melissa's father, Patrick Braden, lived together but never married.

Her mother departed for work at approximately 6:30 a.m. Diamond and her older sister, Tionda, stayed at the house during the morning. Their mother, Tracey Bradley, discovered that the girls were not inside their residence when she returned at approximately 11:00 a.m.

Tionda apparently left a note stating that she and Diamond planned to walk to a nearby school and store. Tionda was enrolled in summer classes at Doolittle Elementary School at the time, but school officials said that she was absent the day of her disappearance.

Several neighborhood children told authorities that they saw Tionda and Diamond playing outside of their residence at approximately 12:00 p.m. Neither child has been heard from again. An extensive search of the surrounding areas produced no clues as to their whereabouts.

Diamond is described as being independent and naturally timid but talkative. Her family said that she often fought with her siblings in 2001. Diamond enjoys eating peanuts and ramen noodles.

Authorities said that Tracey was not cooperating with investigators in relation to her daughters' cases. She shoved a police officer who requested that she accompany him to the precinct to discuss new leads in March 2002. Tracey was placed in handcuffs and taken to the station, where she briefly spoke with investigators. Her attorney arrived shortly thereafter and stopped the interview.

Authorities said that Tracey missed several scheduled appointments with detectives in the past. Tracey's spiritual advisor told the media that officers had violated her rights by forcibly taking her to the precinct. Authorities said that Tracey was physically combative and they needed to restrain her in handcuffs.

Kelly Branam,"September 23, 2007","Miami, Florida",30,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",130 lbs,"Kelly and her husband, Jake, were last seen on September 23, 2007. They left Miami Beach in Florida in Jake's 47-foot fishing vessel, the Joe Cool, with Jake's half-brother, Scott Gamble; a friend, Samuel Kairy; and two others, Kirby Logan Archer and Guillermo Zarabozo. A photograph of the Joe Cool is posted with this case summary.

They planned to take Archer and Zarabozo to the Bahamas to meet their girlfriends, then return to Miami the following day. Archer and Zarabozo paid them $4,000 for the trip. The Branams, Gamble and Kairy have never been heard from again. Photographs of Archer and Zarabozo are posted with this case summary.

Between 4:00 and 5:45 p.m. September 24, Jake's uncle contacted authorities to say Kelly, Jake, Gamble and Kairy had not arrived back in Miami as scheduled. They were expected to return no later than noon.

Authorities discovered that a patrol boat had already located the Joe Cool at 6:00 p.m. on September 23, adrift in the Straits of Florida, 20 miles from Cuba and nearly 160 miles off its course. There was no one on board. The boat was in disarray and the life rafts were missing; it appeared as if the occupants had left hurriedly. A search was launched for the missing captain and crew.

Zarabozo and Archer were found in a life raft at 9:45 a.m. on September 27, not far from where the Joe Cool had been located. They were rescued and questioned by investigators. Zarabozo was later charged with making false statements to a federal agent.

Investigators discovered Archer had a warrant out for his arrest; in January 2007 he allegedly stole $92,000 from a Wal-Mart store in Arkansas where he had been an assistant manager. He was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. An extensive search turned up no sign of the others from the boat.

On October 10, Archer and Zarabozo were charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, one for each of the missing individuals from the boat. Authorities stated both suspects made inconsistent statements: they could not agree how and when they met one another or what exactly happened on board the Joe Cool, and they could not provide any information about the girlfriends they planned to meet in the Bahamas.

Zarabozo told investigators that three armed men had hijacked the boat and shot the Branams, Kairy and Gamble. He said he threw the bodies overboard himself and cleaned up the mess. However, evidence aboard the boat contradicted Zarabozo's story.

He claimed the victims had been all shot outside the cabin of the Joe Cool. Four spent 9-millimeter bullet casings were located on the boat, but three were from inside the vessel's cabin. A blowgun with darts, knives, cellular phones and two pairs of leather gloves without fingers were found in a backpack on Zarabozo and Archer's life raft. Zarabozo later changed his story and said Archer had committed the shootings.

In July 2008, after having asserted his innocence for nearly a year, Archer agreed to change his plea to guilty and testify against Zarabozo. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against him; instead, he was sentenced to five terms of life in prison without parole. Archer stated he and Zarabozo had each killed two of the people on the ship.

At Zarabozo's first trial, in 2008, a jury convicted him of weapons charges but could not reach a verdict on the other charges. The judge threw out those convictions due to faulty jury instructions.

Zarabozo was retried and convicted of sixteen charges, including the four murders, in February 2009. He was sentenced to five life sentences plus eighty-five years. He maintains his innocence, saying Archer committed the murders and threatened to kill him too if he told.

Kelly and Jake have two children together. Jake is described as an experienced, very capable seaman. An extensive search of the ocean did not turn up any of the victims' bodies.

They departed from Santa Barbara Airport on the morning of December 6, and planned to return to Palo Alto by noon so one couple could go buy a Christmas tree. They were aboard a single-engine Piper Archer airplane at the time. The last communication from the aircraft was received about eight minutes later.

Weather conditions at the time the plane was in flight were described as ""treacherous,"" but the pilot did not give any indication that something was wrong on board the aircraft. The plane never arrived in Palo Alto and it and its occupants have never been seen again.

Sabrina Marie Brazel,"August 20, 2006","St. Augustine, Florida",42,African American / Black,"5'3""",100 lbs,"Sabrina was last seen in St. Augustine, Florida during the early morning hours of August 20, 2006. She resided on west Third Street at the time, and her home was under construction. She has never been heard from again. She was reported missing by her husband, Jimmie Brazel. Shortly after her disappearance, some of her belongings were found on west Fourth Street.

When Jimmie contacted authorities to report Sabrina's disappearance, they arrested him for domestic battery. Several days prior to going missing, Sabrina had told police Jimmie had kicked and punched her in their home. When investigators responded to her call, however, they were unable to find Jimmie. They did not locate him until he reported Sabrina as a missing person.

Jimmie was eventually released from jail, but he was rearrested in 2007 for allegedly grabbing a woman off the street and raping her. He was interviewed about Sabrina's disappearance and is not referred to as a suspect, but authorities did search the Brazel home for her body. No evidence was located during the search.

Sabrina had planned to move in with her daughter in Georgia, but she disappeared before the move. It's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. There have been numerous reported sightings of Sabrina in the Jacksonville, Florida area, but none of these have been confirmed.

It's unclear whether the domestic violence incident is related to Sabrina's later disappearance, but Jimmie is considered a person of interest in her case and hasn't cooperated with the investigation. Her case remains unsolved and foul place is suspected.",http://charleyproject.org/case/sabrina-marie-brazel,-81.3124341,29.9012437
Elizabeth Emma Breck,"January 13, 2019","Saddlebrooke, Arizona",46,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",115 lbs,"On the advice of her psychiatrist, Breck checked herself into the Sierra Tucson behavioral health center in Saddlebrooke, Arizona on January 10, 2019. She planned to complete a thirty-day program for treatment of trauma; she had developed post-traumatic stress disorder after being sexually assaulted.

On January 13, after she was evaluated, the staff determined she was not a threat to herself or others and admitted her to the general living quarters, which aren't locked down. She was last seen at 3:00 p.m. During the late afternoon hours, Breck was discovered missing.

Her medical bracelet and other belongings were found in her assigned room, but there was no indication of her whereabouts. She left her car at the hospital and is believed to have taken only her driver's license and some cash with her when she disappeared.

In February, Breck's brother filed complaints against Sierra Tucson with the Arizona Department of Health Services and The Joint Commission, a national not-for-profit accreditation agency. Her family alleges the facility didn't share information with them and the private investigator they hired to find Breck, there was no electronic surveillance to ensure patient safety, and Breck wasn't provided with a phone to call her parents, who live outside the U.S.

It's extremely uncharacteristic of Breck to be out of touch with her friends and family, whom she was close to. She was interested in dancing and involved in a number of dance groups, and was also involved with spirituality, particularly Buddhism. She was a teacher at the Tucson Magnet School at the time of her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/elizabeth-emma-breck,-110.8835377,32.5355117

She was going to Bakersfield, California with her boyfriend, Julio Jesus Cruz, a long-haul truck driver. They were riding in an orange 18-wheeler truck with the Florida license plate number F3171P.

Bromet didn't take a cellular phone with her for her trip, and all communications with her family were through Cruz's phone. The last time her family heard from her was on November 17, when she called her father. She was ""distressed"" at the time of the conversation and said she wanted to go home.

Her father told Cruz to take her to an airport, and offered to buy her a plane ticket home. Bromet's father heard her ask Cruz, ""Well, what do you think?"" Then the line went dead. When Bromet's father called back, Cruz answered the phone and told him Bromet was asleep. She never contacted her family again.

Cruz stated they arrived in California on November 19. He said that on November 20, he dropped Bromet off at a shopping center in El Centro with $40 so she could go shopping while he completed deliveries.

Bromet's family stated that although she struggled with addiction, she never went longer than a couple of days without contacting them. She hasn't accessed her bank account since her disappearance; she had disability payments automatically deposited there every month.

Although Cruz says he last saw her in El Centro, her family isn't sure she ever made it as far as California. California authorities are investigating her disappearance, which remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/nancy-claira-bromet,-115.5630514,32.792
Casey Joanna Brooks,"January 29, 2008","Tiburon, California",17,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",124 lbs,"Casey was last seen on January 29, 2008. She left her Tiburon, California home at 5:00 a.m. and never returned. Video surveillance cameras at the Golden Gate Bridge showed Casey parking her car at the north end and walking onto the bridge on the east sidewalk. She smoked a cigarette, climbed over the rail and jumped. Casey left a note behind at home saying, ""The Saab is parked at the Golden Gate Bridge. I'm sorry.""

Casey was born in Poland and spent the first months of her life in an orphanage. She was born prematurely and had to spend an extended time period in the hospital, and her twin sister died at birth. She was adopted by an American couple in July 1991, and they took her back to the United States in August.

She was a senior at Redwood High School at the time of her disappearance, and a very good student. She had obtained early admission to Bennington College in Vermont, her first-choice school, where she planned to study journalism and environmental science.

Casey was taking a heavy academic load that included advanced placement classes, and she was stressed over her coursework. In addition, she had recently had a fight with her parents and they cut off her allowance and driving privileges.

Her family stated her emotional problems became evident in middle school. Her parents took her to several therapists, who all suggested different diagnoses and methods of treatment, but Casey was uncooperative.

She seemed much calmer and happier in the year before her death, however. In spite of her history, her loved ones don't think she was seriously depressed and they characterized her presumed suicide as an impulsive act.

Alesha L. Brookshier,"September 28, 2008","Farmington, New Mexico",37,Caucasian / White,"5'1""",105 lbs,"Brookshier was last seen at to the Garden of Eden, the tanning salon she owned in Farmington, New Mexico, on September 28, 2008. She lived on San Juan County Road in Aztec, New Mexico together with her ex-husband, Andre Lobato. Lobato said they went to the salon and she packed some belongings in her car, a silver four-door 2000 Saturn with the New Mexico license plate number JWF 653, and simply left. She has never been heard from again.

In 2009, police found Brookshier's vehicle abandoned and burned on Andrea Drive in Aztec. Witnesses reported seeing someone running away as it burned. The car had had a different license plate, but the vehicle identification number was the same. Investigators determined the car had never left Farmington following Brookshier's disappearance.

Lobato never reported his ex-wife missing. Brookshier's sister stated she notified the Aztec Police Department of her disappearance about six months after it happened, but the police have no record of a missing persons report being filed.

The mistake wasn't rectified until January 2011, when one of Brookshier's cousins reported her disappearance to the San Juan County Sheriff's Office. By the time this formal report was filed, over two years had passed since Brookshier went missing.

In September 2007, Brookshier's ex-boyfriend, Joseph Marin, gave her a check for $2,200 in payment for work she'd done for him. They agreed that she would not cash it. In October 2008, over a year after Brookshier received the check and a month after her disappearance, Marin discovered someone had cashed the check. He contacted the police, who learned that Lobato had cashed it at the Hi-Way Grill in Aztec. The date on the check had been changed from September 19, 2007 to September 19, 2008.

When authorities questioned Lobato about the check, he said Brookshier had mailed it to him and he cashed it for her and kept the money, which he said she owed him. He used part of it to pay off a loan. The check had Brookshier's driver's license number written on it. Lobato said he didn't have her license and Brookshier had written the number herself, but an employee at the Hi-Way Grill said Lobato had brought the license in with him when he cashed the check.

Lobato also cashed another check to Brookshier from Marin, worth $1,000, after her disappearance, and investigators believe this check was also altered. He initially deposited the money in Brookshier's bank account, but withdrew it all within two days.

Lobato was charged with fraud and forgery in connection with the two cashed checks, but those charges were dropped for lack of evidence in December 2011. Hee hasn't faced charges in Brookshier's disappearance and authorities are uncertain as to what happened to her. She has two children and she and Lobato had been divorced since 2001.

Since Brookshier went missing, there has been no activity on her Social Security number. It's uncharacteristic of her to be out of touch with her sister; before she vanished, they spoke to each other nearly every day. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/alesha-l-brookshier,-108.2064118,36.7285398

Bross's family said that it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning; she always kept her family informed of her whereabouts and made arrangements for someone to care for her cat if she planned on an extended absence. The animal was left behind when she disappeared.

Amanda Victoria Brown,"September 11, 1998","Tampa, Florida",7,Caucasian / White,"4'4""",45 lbs,"Amanda's mother, Kathryn Hartman, met Willie Seth Crain Jr. at a bar in mid-September 1998 in Tampa, Florida. A photo of Crain is posted with this case summary. Hartman told authorities that she and Amanda visited Crain's trailer during the evening of September 10, 1998, and they watched the movie Titanic.

Hartman stated that she caught Crain alone in his bedroom with Amanda. He was apparently intoxicated at the time. Amanda was sitting between his legs and he was showing her how to use the remote control. Hartman said that she separated her daughter from Crain and drove to their own mobile home in the 10900 block of Old Hillsborough Avenue.

Crain followed them inside and drew some pictures with Amanda. She took a shower and changed into her nightgown, and he insisted on drying her hair before she went to bed. Hartman invited him to stay the night and sober up.

Amanda did not go to bed until approximately 2:15 a.m. She went to sleep in her mother's bed, and Hartman joined her at 2:30. About five minutes later, Crain got into bed with them, still dressed and wearing his shoes, and the adults fell asleep with Amanda between them.

Hartman told investigators that Crain had given her five tablets of Valium, a strong sedative, during the evening. Hartman was addicted to prescription painkillers and it wasn't unusual for her to take this amount. She didn't wake up until 6:00 a.m. the following morning, September 11. Hartman stated that both Amanda and Crain had disappeared by that time. Nothing else was missing from the home.

After she searched the trailer and couldn't find Amanda, Hartman called Crain to ask what he had done with her. Crain said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and suggested Hartman call his daughter, who was her friend and had introduced her to Crain. He said he had to go and would call her back, but he never did. Hartman called the police after she spoke with Crain. Amanda has never been heard from again.

Amanda's father, Ron Brown, was briefly considered a suspect in her disappearance. He and Hartman never married, and he lived with his wife in Lakeland, Florida in 1998. He saw Amanda on a regular basis; the last time was the day before her disappearance.

Ron's relationship with Hartman was contentious. Hartman had accused him of molesting the child and the police investigated, but no charges were filed. She had also accused him of threatening to kidnap Amanda. Very quickly Ron was cleared of suspicion in Amanda's disappearance, however, and the investigation focused on Crain.

Crain has a criminal history dating back to 1969. In 1985, he was convicted of three counts of sexual battery on a child and served six years of a twenty-year prison sentence; his victims in that case were all girls under the age of eleven, some of them relatives and some of them neighbor children. Due to his criminal history and the circumstances, he was considered a suspect in Amanda's disappearance from the beginning.

He told his family he'd left Hartman's house at 2:30 a.m. and Amanda was sleeping in Hartman's bed at the time. When interviewed by law enforcement, he had several scratches that he couldn't explain. He gave the police permission to search his trailer in the 10600 block of Leanne Drive.

Crain had washed his rugs and cleaned the bathroom floor with bleach, but authorities discovered blood on his toilet seat and bloody tissue in the bowl. Blood was also found on Crain's boxer shorts. The blood matched Amanda's DNA. When police sprayed the bathroom with Luminol, a chemical which lights up when it detects blood traces, it lit up all over the room, including on the floors, walls and bathtub. It should be noted, however, that Luminol also reacts with bleach, which Crain admitted to using in the bathroom.

The Brown case was covered extensively in Florida newspapers and on television. A week after she vanished, two women came forward and said Crain had sexually assaulted them repeatedly between 1965 and 1971, when they were children. Police arrested Crain on rape charges as a result. A short time later, he was charged with Amanda's murder.

Investigators believe that Crain, who was a commercial crab fisherman, dumped Amanda's body in one of his frequent fishing areas after sexually assaulting and murdering her. Another crab fisherman who knew him saw him launch his boat at the Courtney Campbell Causeway on Tampa Bay early on the morning of September 11.

The witness said Crain was wearing dress clothes, not the jeans he usually wore, and he wasn't wearing rain gear or a slicker to protect his clothes. Crain also backed his truck much deeper into the water than usual when he launched his boat. The same witness stated he'd heard Crain boasting, about eighteen months prior to Amanda's disappearance, that he would be able to get rid of a body so no one could find it.

Crain denied the charges, but was found guilty in 1999 and sentenced to death. His victims from the 1985 cases were allowed to testify at the penalty phase of his trial. Because he had been convicted of murder and given the most severe possible sentence, he was never prosecuted for the old rapes. He is presently on Florida's death row, but he is suffering from colon cancer and may not live long enough to be executed.

Amanda was a second-grade student at Lopez Elementary School at the time of her disappearance. She has never been located.",http://charleyproject.org/case/amanda-victoria-brown,-82.3183036,27.9962074

They had three children together: Sheketah, Barry and Brandon. Carolyn and James had been married for ten years and were employed as teachers. The family resided in Port St. Lucie, Florida.

The entire family disappeared on July 25, 1985. Carolyn's mother called police in August, worried because she had not heard from her daughter or her daughter's husband or children since July 4. Investigators did go to the Brown home but were initially unconcerned, as there were no obvious indications of foul play inside the residence.

Carolyn's purse was located in a corner of the garage; inside it, every piece of her identification had been cut up. An uneaten meal was spread out on the dining room table. One of the rooms in the house had been freshly painted; a closer look revealed that the paint had covered up bloodstains on the walls, but this was not noticed until later.

The family was officially listed as missing after the next school year began and neither Carolyn nor James reported to teach. Later, James called Carolyn's sister and told her she could have everything inside his home. Carolyn's sister asked where the rest of the family was and James replied, ""Out there.""

James resurfaced in Savannah, Georgia several weeks after his family's disappearances. He checked into the hospital under the name Demetrius Jones and stated someone had robbed him and shot him in the head. His true identity was discovered and he admitted he had murdered his wife and children and tried to to take his own life.

James told authorities that he shot Carolyn while she slept inside their home during the night of their disappearances. James said that Brandon was sleeping beside his mother; he claimed that he smothered the child with a pillow, then disposed of both of their bodies in Palm Beach County, Florida. He told investigators that he drove Sheketah and Barry to Brunswick, Georgia along Interstate 95 on July 17, three days after Carolyn and Brandon were murdered. James said he shot Barry in the head and his daughter in the face, then disposed of their remains along the highway.

A jury acquitted James in Carolyn and Sheketah's deaths in late 1985. He was never charged with Brandon and Barry's homicides, as authorities were not certain of the location of the presumed murders. Extensive searches of the areas produced no evidence as to the family's whereabouts, and some investigators believe James lied about where he disposed of the bodies.

Several court-appointed mental health professionals diagnosed James as a paranoid schizophrenic; he stated he heard voices and saw visions. He was committed to a Florida mental health facility after the court's decision in 1985. He was moved to a halfway house in 1996 and released from the program in 1997.

Although Brown's family stated she was having personal problems and hanging out with the wrong crowd at the time of her disappearance, it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her loved ones don't think she would have abandoned her young daughter.

#MP20955 Cindy May Brown,"March 10, 1980","Roseville, Minnesota",22,Caucasian / White,"5'2""",110 lbs,"Brown was last seen in Roseville, Minnesota on March 10, 1980. She told her supervisor at K-Mart that she was leaving town. She has never been heard from again. Her roommate, Patrick Thomas Walsh, told police she'd left for California in a brown van with a woman and two men, leaving her own car behind.

At the time, authorities believed she'd left of her own accord. She wasn't reported missing until July 29, four and a half months after she was last seen. She lived on Rice Street in Roseville at the time of her disappearance.

Walsh had an extensive criminal record as a teenager, and he had previously spent time in St. Peter Hospital after being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the attempted murder of a 23-year-old woman. He was released in 1977, three years before Brown's disappearance; doctors at the hospital stated he had an anti-social personality but wasn't mentally ill.

In 1984, another acquaintance of Walsh's, Cindy Gerdes, was found stabbed to death. In 1991, he was charged with murdering an female coworker, Pamela Susan Sweeney. He was found guilty of murder, burglary and sexual assault in that case.

Walsh is considered a possible suspect in Gerdes's murder and Brown's disappearance, which has been reclassified as a possible homicide. Neither of their cases have ever been solved, however, and Brown has never been located.

Norine Higuchi BrownÊ Ê*,"December 12, 1990","New Hyde Park, New York",31,"Asian, White/Caucasian",,,"Norine was last seen in New Hyde Park, New York at 11:00 p.m. on December 12, 1990, the day before her thirty-second birthday. Her husband, John Brown, said she left to go buy ingredients for Christmas cookies and never returned. She has never been heard from again.

The next morning, John called Norine's friend, Elaine Commando, and said she'd never come home the night before. He said they'd argued and asked if Norine had spent the night at Commando's house, which was near the Browns' home. She hadn't; Commando had no idea where she was.

John asked Commando to go to the Pathmark Super Center (now defunct) on Jericho Turnpike in Garden City Park, New York and look for her car. The shopping center was only about a mile from the Browns' home. Commando went there and found Norine's station wagon abandoned in the parking lot; it was locked and there were wrapped Christmas presents inside it.

Norine has never been heard from again. She had only $45 in her pocketbook at the time of her disappearance, and she left her wallet and identification behind at home.

Investigators don't know whether she actually went inside the supermarket that night. It wasn't uncharacteristic of her to go shopping at odd hours, because she preferred to go when stores were less crowded. A Pathmark employee recalled seeing Norine's car in the parking lot shortly after 11:00 p.m. on the night of her disappearance, but no one remembered seeing Norine herself.

Commando stated John and Norine had a rocky relationship and she thinks John may have killed her. He hired an attorney after her disappearance and refused to let police search his and Norine's home and property. He maintains his innocence in her case and stated he thinks Norine was murdered.

Norine left behind two children under the age of two. Her husband has since remarried and had two more children, and still lives in the local area. No one has been named as a suspect in Norine's disappearance.",http://charleyproject.org/case/norine-higuchi-brown,-73.6879082,40.7351018
Regina F. Brown,"March 26, 1987","Queens, New York",35,Black/African American,"5' 3""",115 lbs,"Regina is of Creole descent; she has very light skin and appears to be Caucasian. Regina was last seen at LaGuardia Airport in the New York City borough of Queens on March 26, 1987. She resided on Whippoorwill Hill Road in Newtown, Connecticut at the time of her disappearance, and was employed as a flight attendant for American Airlines. Regina had previously sent two of her three children to live with her mother in Texas and she was last seen after placing her third child and the family's live-in babysitter on a plane to join the others.

On the way back to Newtown, Regina called her best friend and said that if her parents hadn't heard from her within four days, to be alarmed. She said that in that instance, her friend should wait another two days, then try to contact her. If her friend was still unable to reach her, that meant her estranged husband of five years had ""done to me what he promised to do to me.""

On March 27, Regina's dog began barking continuously and a neighbor called the police to complain, but nothing was done. Regina subsequently missed a lunch date with her best friend and two flight assignments with American Airlines. Her employer notified her parents, who asked her best friend to check on her.

On April 2, Regina's friend went to her home, opened the garage door and found her dog alone. The floor was covered with feces and there was a bowl of water and an unopened bag of dog food which had been purchased at a supermarket Regina didn't shop at.

Regina's best friend and her estranged husband, Willis Brown, both filed missing persons reports for her. It turned out it was he who had left the dog food bag at her home. He said he bought it on March 26, the same day he was in Newtown for a dental appointment, but couldn't remember what else he'd done that day.

Regina left most of her personal belongings behind at her residence, including her airline identification badge, her makeup bag and a check for $1,000. Willis suggested the police look for her car in a certain part of the New York City borough of Manhattan, a neighborhood known for its drug activity.

On April 6, her bronze Honda Accord hatchback was found parked in front of an apartment building on 104th Street in Manhattan. The keys were in the ignition, there were two child seats in the backseat, and the windshield had several parking tickets. There was no sign of her at the scene and no indications of a struggle.

Regina had been in the process of a divorce from Willis, a senior American Airlines pilot. Willis into an apartment in Queens, New York, and Regina had a court order barring him from the house in Newtown. She did let him come over to visit their children, however.

The Browns' marriage had been troubled, with allegations of domestic violence. Willis insisted the couple's children had been fathered by other men, although paternity testing proved otherwise. In June 1987, he drove to Texas, forcibly removed his children from their grandparents' home and took them back to Connecticut, where he hired another live-in babysitter to care for them. Three weeks later, however, a judge ordered him to return the children to the care of Regina's Texas relatives.

Willis went forward with the divorce after Regina's disappearance and the case went to court on September 28. He sought custody of the children and no longer denied paternity, and claimed his wife had abused drugs and had numerous affairs, including one with the couple's marriage counselor (whom Regina saw alone, after Willis refused to go). He had made similar allegations during his divorce from his first wife.

One of Regina's friends testified against him in court, saying Regina was terrified of her husband. Her loved ones described her as a deeply religious woman and a devoted mother who wouldn't have abandoned her children, and police never found any evidence of extramarital affairs or drug use on her part.

In April 1988, the divorce judge granted custody to Regina's family in Texas. In his ruling, the judge wrote Willis had physically and mentally abused his wife and ""reduced her existence to a living nightmare."" After Regina's disappearance, Willis told various people false stories that she had been sighted in faraway places around the world.

Willis has never been charged in connection with his wife's disappearance or even been named as a suspect, although police did call him a ""person of interest."" A Massachusetts television station did a documentary on Regina's case in 1990; the program implied Willis was responsible for his wife's murder. He sued the television station for defamation, invasion of privacy and and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but his claims were dismissed.

The police did not search Regina's house until May 7, six weeks after her disappearance. They did search a tract of land for her body in 1989. Willis had rented a trailer on the property at the time of Regina's disappearance. No evidence was uncovered during any of the searches.

Willis owned a small private plane in 1987 and the police were unable to locate it for years. They finally found it in 2008. They weren't able to determine whether Willis was using the plane at the time of Regina's disappearance, however, as the airport he used was a very small one that didn't keep a consistent record of flights.

Regina's disappearance remains unsolved and foul play is suspected. She was declared legally dead in 1995.",http://charleyproject.org/case/regina-f-brownÊ https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/2018,-73.8733014,40.7767283

Bruce was seen at the Malones Bar on Main Street with a young man driving a late model red Ford F-150 truck earlier on the night of her disappearance. She left with the man at 11:30 p.m. She has never been heard from again.

Police have identified the man Bruce was with on the night she vanished. He traveled to Atlanta, Georgia after her disappearance and police questioned him about Bruce after he was arrested there on unrelated charges of marijuana possession and driving on a suspended license. Authorities haven't named him publicly, but they are calling him a person of interest in her case. He told his questioners that he and Bruce parted ways after they left the bar and he never saw her after that.

Bruce is described as a devoted parent who would never abandoned her two children willingly. She missed both their birthdays later in October 2008. She left all her belongings behind, including her hairbrush and toothbrush, and she doesn't have credit cards, debit cards, a checking account, a cellular phone or a car. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance.http://charleyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dana_jane_bruce_1.jpg",-93.2282613,38.7044609

Renee Bruhl,"July 6, 1966","Indiana Dunes State Park, Indiana",19,Caucasian / White,"5'9""",120 lbs - 150 lbs,"Bruhl and two of her friends, Patricia Blough and Ann Miller, drove to the Indiana Dunes State Park in Indiana on July 2, 1966. Miller drove her four-door 1955 Buick and picked Blough up from her family's residence in Westchester, Illinois at approximately 8:00 a.m. Blough told her mother the women planned to return home early in the evening to allow Bruhl time to prepare dinner for her husband.

Miller and Blough picked up Bruhl from her home on West Fulton Street on the west side of Chicago, Illinois and stopped at a drugstore to purchase suntan lotion. The women arrived at the Indiana Dunes State Park at approximately 10:00 a.m. Miller parked in the park's lot and the women hiked to a spot approximately 100 yards from the Lake Michigan shoreline.

A couple reported seeing the women leave their belongings on the beach at approximately 12:00 p.m. and enter the lake together. The witnesses saw them speaking to an unidentified man operating a 14- to 16-foot-long white boat with a blue interior and and outboard motor sometime afterwards.

The couple reported their observations to a park ranger around dusk when they noticed that the women's belongings were still sitting unclaimed on the beach. The witnesses stated that the women went aboard the boat and headed west with the driver. Bruhl, Blough and Miller have never been seen again.

Bruhl left her large-sized towel, shorts, blouse, cigarettes, suntan lotion, 25 cents and her purse containing approximately $55 in checks on the beach. The three women's belongings were collected by the ranger the night of their disappearance and stored in the Park Superintendent's offices until two days later on July 4, 1966. Blough's father called the office on that day, asking if anyone had seen the women.

The park rangers soon learned that missing persons' reports had been filed for Blough, Miller and Bruhl over the weekend in Illinois by their families. The rangers began investigating the park and located Miller's Buick in the parking lot. Her car keys had been located with her belongings and some items of the women's clothing and other personal effects were still inside the vehicle. The car was apparently parked in its original space from July 2. The park rangers contacted other law enforcement agencies, including the United States Coast Guard.

A search for the missing women was initiated on July 5, three days after the women disappeared. Additional witnesses came forward with conflicting stories regarding the women's last known movements, but authorities believe that the first witnesses' reports stating that the women were seen boarding a boat were the most reliable.

The search was extended to a six-mile stretch of beach west of the state park near the Ogden Dunes later in the week. More witnesses began substantiating the initial reports that the women entered a white boat operated by an unidentified man. Later accounts described the male as in his early twenties with a tanned complexion and dark, wavy hair. He was wearing a beach jacket at the time. A visitor was filming home movies at the state park on July 2 and offered his reels to investigators.

The search was immediately narrowed to two boats once authorities viewed the footage. One was a fiberglass 16- to 18-foot-long trimaran runabout with a three-hulled design, which was operated by a man fitting the description of the unidentified driver. Three females matching the missing women were seen aboard the smaller boat in the footage.

The second boat identified was a 26- to 28-foot-long Trojan cabin cruiser with three men aboard along with three women. The cabin cruiser was seen at approximately 3:00 p.m. three hours after the women entered the smaller vessel.

Investigators believe that the women may have been dropped off on the beach by the driver of the smaller boat while he drove back to retrieve two male friends and the cabin cruiser. Blough, Miller and Bruhl were reportedly seen eating and walking along the sand dunes after this time.

They were approached by another unidentified man, who accompanied them on to the cabin cruiser. Witnesses stated that the cabin cruiser was equipped with a radio/telephone antenna, but apparently did not have a name printed on its stern. This final sighting has never been confirmed, but is considered reliable by authorities.

Investigators began researching the women's backgrounds in an attempt to discover if their disappearances were voluntary. Authorities found a note addressed to Bruhl's husband in her purse. The couple had been married for 15 months in July of 1966. The note stated that Bruhl felt her husband spent too much time working on hot-rod cars with his friends and insinuated that she wanted to leave the relationship.

Her husband told authorities that he was not aware of any major marital problems at the time his wife vanished. Her family agreed with his statement, telling investigators that they felt Bruhl penned the note in a moment of anger and never gave it to her husband because she changed her mind.

All three women were horse enthusiasts, which pointed to a possible connection with criminal activity. Blough and Miller met while boarding their horses at the same Illinois stable. Bruhl was a classmate of Blough's from Proviso West High School in Maywood, Illinois. Bruhl completed a one-year course in medical technology at a school located in The Loop of Chicago after her high school graduation.

Miller and Blough were associated with men who had criminal backgrounds in the horse market. Blough was reportedly having problems with ""horse syndicate people"" in the spring and summer of 1966.

Blough was a very skilled swimmer who could swim 20 to 30 miles; Miller was thought to possess similar abilities and Bruhl's family stated that she had fair swimming skills. Accidental drowning was considered a possibility in the disappearances, but an unlikely one.

Miller's friends told authorities that she was three months pregnant in July of 1966 and mentioned entering a home for unwed mothers prior to her disappearance. Blough may have been pregnant as well. The two women's boyfriends were reportedly both married.

Another person who visited the beach that day was Ralph Largo Jr. He resembled the boat driver Miller, Blough and Bruhl were seen speaking to shortly before they disappeared. He lived with his aunt and uncle in Gary, Indiana. Largo's aunt and uncle performed abortions, which were illegal at the time.

One theory about the women's disappearances is that they went with Largo to a larger boat several miles offshore to get abortions for Miller and Blough, and something went wrong with the procedures and the women were killed and dumped into the lake. This theory has not been confirmed. Largo died in Florida in 2009.

There have been many unconfirmed sightings of the three women throughout the years, but leads never surfaced. The boats they were reportedly seen boarding on July 2, 1966 have never been located, nor have the unidentified men spotted on the vessels been seen again.

Debris from an apparent boat wreck were discovered near the Bailly Generating Station of Northern Indiana Public Service Company on Lake Michigan shortly after the July 2 disappearances. There were no reports of any missing boats the day the women vanished and authorities do not know if the debris is connected to their cases.

Blough, Miller and Bruhl frequently rode horses at Tri Color Stables in Palatine, Illinois in 1966. The stables were owned by George Jayne, a prominent horse dealer. George and his brother, Silas Jayne, were involved in a bitter argument over horse dealing during the mid-1960's. Cheryl Ann Rude, a young woman associated with the horse market, was killed at Tri Color Stables in June 1965 by a car bomb discovered to be intended for George. George asked Rude to move his Cadillac from the stable entrance and the bomb exploded.

Investigators have explored the possibility that Blough, Miller and/or Bruhl may have witnessed the bomb being planted one year prior to their disappearances. This theory may explain Blough's odd remarks about a facial injury she received March 1966 and the connection to ""syndicate"" people. It has never been proven.

George and Silas's phone numbers were discovered in the belongings of one of the missing women in 1966. George was killed by a gunshot wound in 1970; Silas was later convicted of conspiracy in his brother's murder and imprisoned.

Silas died in 1987; he is also a suspect in the 1977 disappearance and probable murder of Helen Brach. In 1997, James Blottiaux was charged with planting the 1965 car bomb that killed Rude at George's stable. None of the men have been proven to have been involved with Blough, Miller and Bruhl's disappearances, but it does lead to speculation that something may have occurred to cause the three women to vanish.

Silas Jayne reportedly told a sheriff that he had three bodies buried underneath his residence some time after the women's 1966 disappearances. Law enforcement took the comment seriously and planned to search Silas's property; the sheriff involved was killed in a farming accident before the search took place. As a result, the lead was left cold.

Chaunti N. Bryla,"March 14, 2019","Chicago, Illinois",43,African American / Black,"5'2""",200 lbs - 210 lbs,"Bryla was last seen when a taxi driver dropped her off at her home near 85th and Bennett in Chicago, Illinois on March 14, 2019. She has never been heard from again. In November 2019, Marvin Bailey, her ten-year-old son's half-brother, was charged with her murder. A photo of Bailey is posted with this case summary.

Investigators believe Bailey killed Bryla sometime between the afternoon of March 14, and three days later. He has a violent history; in November 2018, he was paroled after serving less than four years for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; he had hit his girlfriend with a hammer and set her on fire. He moved into Bryla's home in February 2019 and was living there until Bryla argued with his girlfriend and asked him to move out.

Surveillance footage showed Bailey and another individual, who hasn't been publicly identified, driving around Chicago after Bryla disappeared and purchasing bungee cords, straps and a dolly using cash they got from Bryla's bank account with her debit card. She had recently got her income tax return, and after her disappearance, Bailey and his companion emptied her bank account.

On March 16, Bailey and his companion took a Lyft ride to Bryla's apartment and carried a large blue container out of the building into that Lyft. Eventually, they put the container in Bailey's van. The container was so large and heavy that they were using the dolly they'd bought to carry it. The following day, the pair were briefly detained by Chicago police officers when they tried to run away as officers stopped to check Bailey's van while it was parked in a vacant lot. Bailey and his companion told the police were they on their way to a Home Depot store to buy a chainsaw. They were released without getting cited and without getting the van searched.

Bailey and his friend then took a Lyft to the King's Inn at 128th Street and Ashland Avenue. They took the blue container with them, and Bailey told the Lyft driver he had recently been evicted with all of his belongings and the container held ""his meats."" At the King's Inn, the elevator was inoperable and Bailey and his friend struggled to carrying the blue container up three flights of stairs after Bailey checked in.

Surveillance video showed Bailey using the dolly he'd bought to throw the blue container in a dumpster at a strip mall near the King's Inn. He left with the empty dolly. A worker at the strip mall saw the container and what appeared to be a heavy black bag inside the dumpster.

Investigators believe Bryla's body wound up in an Indiana landfill. They searched the landfill but have not located her remains. However, they did find the blue container with Bryla's DNA inside, as well as a ""significant amount"" of blood in Bryla's apartment, and blood inside Bailey's van and in the King's Inn room he checked into. A cadaver dog indicated the scent of human remains in the alley where the blue container was put in the dumpster. Bailey is awaiting trial in the murder.

According to Bryla's family, she did not have a high risk lifestyle or a history of leaving without warning. She left milk and other perishable food inside her fridge. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/chaunti-n-bryla,-87.5782129,41.7406557

Due to her medical issues, Mary rarely left home, and neighbors described her and her son as reclusive. Mary also has three daughters.

On April 21, hikers found Gary hanging from a tree at Eco Park in St. Charles, Missouri; he'd taken his own life. When the police went to the Buckley home to inform Mary, they discovered she was missing. She has never been heard from again.

Mary's silver 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe was found in a wooded area just south of the Highway 370 bridge in the Bridgeton, Missouri area, near the train trestle, on the east side of the Missouri River. Investigators believe Gary parked it there and stated the vehicle appeared to have been deliberately hidden.

Gary left two suicide notes; one was left inside Mary's car, and the other simply said ""I'm sorry"" and was carved on a piece of wood and left at the base of the tree where he died. Investigators determined he died around the time Mary was last seen.

Two years prior to her disappearance, Marialice's name was listed on a federal search warrant as an informant. Twelve years old at the time, she had reportedly told the authorities that dynamite and machine guns were hidden in the headquarters of an Omaha group called the National Committee to Combat Fascism, which was an offshoot of the Black Panther Party. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) had gotten a warrant to search the building, but the search never happened.

In August 1970, someone lured police to an abandoned Omaha building where a suitcase full of dynamite exploded, killing one police officer and injuring another one. David Rice and Ed Poindexter, two leaders of the National Committee to Combat Fascism, were charged with the officer's murder, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Rice died in prison in 2016; Poindexter remains incarcerated, even though the Nebraska Parole Board voted unanimously in favor of both men's release. They maintained their innocence over the years and stated they believed they were framed by a conspiracy involving multiple government agencies.

It's unclear whether Marialice's alleged role as a police informant was a factor in her later disappearance, but her brother believes the ATF lied about her giving them information and placed her in danger by naming her in the warrant.

Lilawattie Buerattan,"June 5, 1994","Loxahatchee, Florida",36,Asian,"5'5""",115 lbs,"Buerattan was a breeder of exotic birds on a ranch in Loxahatchee, Florida in 1994. She worked with her nephew, Bhagwaniala Lall. Lall acted as the main businessperson, and Buerettan was the birds' primary caregiver.

Their family in Guyana had an established business importing wild birds, but Lall and Buerattan began breeding the birds instead when the United States tightened laws regarding imports in 1993. Lall and Buerrattan were said to be private people who kept their business affairs to themselves.

A feed delivery person made a routine stop at their ranch on June 5, 1994. No one greeted the worker at the gate, which was unusual. He knew that Lall and Buerattan did not stock reserve feed for the birds, so the worker left the boxes at the gate. The feed was unclaimed when he returned the following day and he alerted authorities.

Investigators did not search the ranch until June 16, 1994, ten days after Lall and Buerattan's absences were reported, due to a bureaucratic error. Authorities discovered hundreds of birds dead or dying of starvation inside the ranch when the search was finally initiated. There was no sign of Buerattan or her nephew. Their ranch hands, Daljeet Gobin and Roland Felix Eyoum, were also missing.

Investigators determined that there was approximately $700,000 worth of wild birds inside the ranch. Authorities said it appeared that the property's occupants had been interrupted by unknown individual(s) prior to their disappearances.

Gobin and Eyoum had been employed at the ranch since its opening in 1992. Gobin had handled the daily operations of the ranch at Lall's request. Eyoum was located in New York City, New York on June 18, 1994, thirteen days after Lall and Buerattan's disappearances.

Eyoum told authorities that Gobin said he witnessed two unidentified men force Lall and Buerattan into a white van at gunpoint. According to Eyoum, Gobin claimed that several birds were also taken into the vehicle as well.

Gobin was apprehended in Georgia on June 7, 1994, two days after Lall and Buerattan vanished. He told authorities he was Lall, then disappeared after being released. Investigators learned Gobin's true identity when he was no longer in custody. It is not known if Gobin is involved with Lall and Buerattan's disappearances, but authorities would like to question him regarding the case.

A photo of Gobin is posted with this case summary. He is described as Asian, 5'5 - 5'7 with black hair and brown eyes. He was approximately 38 years old in 1994. His nickname is Hari. Gobin may use the aliases Harry Gobin and/or Black Gobin. He is originally from Guyana.

Lall and Buerattan's surviving birds were publicly auctioned off in Florida later in 1994. Their family attempted to purchase the birds from the government, but arrangements fell through.

Lall and Buerattan's relatives stated that they would never abandon the animals willingly. Foul play is suspected in their disappearances, although authorities did recover a videotape from Lall's van which explained how to change one's identity. Their cases remain unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lilawattie-buerattan,-80.2401755,26.7726772

However, investigators don't think she went missing at that time.

At the time of her disappearance, Bullock was allegedly working as a waitress at a truck stop on Highway 26 in Poplarville, Mississippi. Indications are that Bullock continued to work there until early to mid-1978; this is the last indication of her whereabouts.

The owner of the truck stop was Burnell ""Dick"" Dedeaux. In 1981, Dedeaux murdered his girlfriend and then took his own life. It's unclear whether Bullock actually knew Dedeaux, but authorities would like to know if anyone saw her around the time of his death.

They lived in a house on Division Street in the Glassell Park area, and Carmen's mother lived upstairs.

That morning, Carmen's mother went downstairs and visited the family at breakfast. Carmen was crying, but her mother didn't ask her why. At about noon, Carmen, Diego and Barbara drove away in their brown 1977 Toyota Corolla. Carmen's mother never saw them again. They took nothing with them; they left behind luggage, clothes in the closets, dog food in the refrigerator, and the dog itself.

On April 25, the family's car was found abandoned in a snowbank 500 feet down a gorge in the San Gabriel Mountains, off Route 2 near Big Pines, California. It was buried in five feet of snow and the top was crushed in. There was no blood inside the car and no evidence of foul play.

That particular road had been closed since March 16, the day after the Garcia/Burhans family vanished. Police theorized the vehicle was either pushed down the mountain by someone trying to conceal it, or accidentally bumped off the roadside by a snowplow whose driver didn't notice it parked there.

Diego is Carmen's second husband and Barbara's stepfather. There were rumors that Carmen, who had recently converted to Mormonism, was involved in a cult-type religion involving candles and live chicken sacrifice at the time of her disappearance, but this wasn't confirmed.

Another theory was that Diego had gotten involved in a drug and/or gambling scheme and he and Carmen took Barbara and fled to the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida; this too could not be substantiated.

Although there were reported sightings of Carmen after her disappearance, none were confirmed, and there were no sightings of Diego or Barbara. There has been no evidence of any of their whereabouts since March 1982.",http://charleyproject.org/case/barbara-aurora-burhans,-117.6950543,34.3730302

Chapin's mother, Sandra Klemp, stated Chapin had gone to Florida with another man in a black 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier. She has never been heard from again. She wasn't reported missing until November 2008, and the Dent County Sheriff's Office didn't actually begin investigating her case until 2012, six years after she was last seen. Her mother has never cooperated with the investigation into her daughter's disappearance.

Chapin's fiance moved out of the apartment about a month after her disappearance. When cleaning out the unit, the apartment building's owner noted that a window was broken and there was a large dark-colored stain on the carpet that couldn't be shampooed out. The apartment owner didn't suspect foul play at the time and threw the carpet away. The unit was later destroyed in an accidental fire.

Chapin's stepfather, Gary McCullough, disappeared in 1999, when she was thirteen years old. In 2003, Chapin went to Gary's brother Albert and told him her Sandra had shot Gary three times in the head and then made her help clean up the crime scene.

Chapin said she and Sandra cleaned up the blood, pulled up the carpets and bleached the floor, and they wrapped Gary's body in plastic and burned it in a brush fire until only bone fragments remained. She had told a similar story to one of her sisters. She said she did it because she didn't want her mother to go to prison and leave her five sisters without a caregiver.

Albert recorded Chapin's statement without her knowledge and took the tape to the authorities. When the sheriff's office contacted Chapin, however, Sandra hired a lawyer for her, and she exercised her right to remain silent and refused to speak to the police. She did not recant her statement, however.

Sandra claimed her marriage to Gary was a happy one, but Gary's friends stated the relationship was very troubled and he planned to leave her and was moving his belongings into a friend's residence. She was having an affair with Kristopher Klemp at the time of Gary's disappearance, something Kristopher admitted to the police. Gary was allegedly aware of the affair.

Within a few days of Gary's disappearance, Kristopher had moved in with Sandra. In June 1999, authorities charged Klemp with conspiracy to commit murder; he allegedly tried to hire someone to kill Gary. The charge was dropped for lack of evidence in August 1999, however.

Kristopher and Sandra married each other in May 2000, one month after she obtained a divorce from Gary. Kristopher was Sandra's fourth husband. Gary's brother Albert had been her second, and Gary was her third.

Chapin disappeared approximately three years after she made her statement. She left a young son in Sandra's care. Sandra had wanted legal guardianship over Chapin's son, but Chapin refused to consent saying it would happen ""over my dead body."" She wanted to take the child with her and move to Arkansas. Sandra has since adopted the boy.

Gary was declared legally dead in 2005. In 2012, his two daughters filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Chapin, Sandra and Kristopher, as well as Kristopher's former wife, Jennifer Lee Brattin-Klemp. The lawsuit alleged Sandra and Kristopher conspired to kill Gary. Jennifer allegedly picked Kristopher up outside the McCullough property in the early morning hours around the time Gary disappeared, and Kristopher had a gun with him at the time.

Although a summons was issued for Chapin to testify in the civil trial, it was never delivered. The tape-recorded statement she made was not played before the jury, although Chapin's sister testified that Chapin had made a similar statement to her. Two of Sandra's children stated they had seen Gary's truck still parked at home on the evening of his disappearance, after Sandra said he had already left.

In the summer of 2013, the civil jury unanimously awarded $7 million in damages to Gary's daughters in connection with his wrongful death. Kristopher and Sandra divorced in 2014 and Sandra has since married her fifth husband and lives in Mount Vernon, Missouri.

Chapin attended Salem High School, but did not graduate. She got involved with drugs while she was still young and got into minor trouble with the law, but she was close to her family and her sisters said she tried to be a good mother to her son and would not have willingly abandoned him.

There has been no activity on Chapin's Social Security number since her disappearance, and she left all her belongings behind. It's unclear whether Gary and Chapin's disappearances are connected, but foul play is suspected in both cases.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/5373

Brenda Schmalfeldt,"January 13, 2007","Las Vegas, NV",45,White/Caucasian,"5'2""",225 lbs,"Schmalfeldt was last seen leaving the Zodies Bar in the 3000 block of Flamingo Road near Eastern Avenue in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 13, 2007. She had been drinking there and the bartender cut her off. She walked out of the bar with an acquaintance, Raven Navajo, at 3:00 p.m.

Less than a week after Schmalfeldt's disappearance, Navajo went to police and confessed she had killed her. Navajo stated the two of them went to Navajo's residence to watch movies, then Navajo accused Schmalfeldt of stealing money and they had an argument that escalated into a fight.

Navajo said she beat Schmalfeldt to death, then stole $580 from the dead woman's purse. She said she was drunk at the time and ""blacked out"" after hitting Schmalfeldt the first time, and did not realize she had killed her until she woke up later and saw the corpse. She kept Schmalfeldt's body for several days before putting the remains in a dumpster behind the Clark County Education Association in the 4200 block of McLeod Drive.

Authorities found Schmalfeldt's blood in Navajo's garage, on the hood of Navajo's 1996 Chrysler Sebring and in the dumpster. Schmalfeldt's jewelry was also located in Navajo's apartment.

Navajo was charged with murder and robbery and investigators began a search for Schmalfeldt's body, which is believed to be in the Apex Landfill. An extensive search of the landfill failed to turn up any evidence, however, and police eventually stopped looking.

In October 2007, Navajo attempted to plead guilty to first-degree murder. Prosecutors had offered to let her plead to second-degree murder instead, but Navajo insisted she wanted the harshest possible punishment. The presiding judge refused to accept Navajo's plea, ruling that there was insufficient evidence of premeditation to prove first-degree murder, so Navajo went to trial.

Her attorney conceded she had caused Schmalfeldt's death, but argued that it was an accident. In February 2008, Navajo was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to ten years to life in prison. Three of the jurors said they had wanted to convict her of a lesser offense such as manslaughter, but they didn't have the option.

Schmalfelt was a regular customer at Zodies Bar prior to her disappearance. She is originally from Iowa. At the time of her disappearance, she was employed as a cocktail waitress at the New York-New York and had three pet dogs. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/brenda-schmalfeldt,-115.1872072,36.115297
Carmen Maria Burhans Garcia,"March 15,1982","Los Angeles, California",41,Caucasian / White,"5'6""",210 lbs,"Carmen was last seen with her husband, Diego Garcia, and daughter, Barbara Burhans, in Los Angeles, California on March 15, 1982. They lived in a house on Division Street in the Glassell Park area, and Carmen's mother lived upstairs.

That morning, Carmen's mother went downstairs and visited the family at breakfast. Carmen was crying, but her mother didn't ask her why. At about noon, Carmen, Diego and Barbara drove away in their brown 1977 Toyota Corolla. Carmen's mother never saw them again. They took nothing with them; they left behind luggage, clothes in the closets, dog food in the refrigerator, and the dog itself.

On April 25, the family's car was found abandoned in a snowbank 500 feet down a gorge in the San Gabriel Mountains, off Route 2 near Big Pines, California. It was buried in five feet of snow and the top was crushed in. There was no blood inside the car and no evidence of foul play.

That particular road had been closed since March 16, the day after the Garcia/Burhans family vanished. Police theorized the vehicle was either pushed down the mountain by someone trying to conceal it, or accidentally bumped off the roadside by a snowplow whose driver didn't notice it parked there.

Diego is Carmen's second husband and Barbara's stepfather. There were rumors that Carmen, who had recently converted to Mormonism, was involved in a cult-type religion involving candles and live chicken sacrifice at the time of her disappearance, but this wasn't confirmed.

Another theory was that Diego had gotten involved in a drug and/or gambling scheme and he and Carmen took Barbara and fled to the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida; this too could not be substantiated.

Although there were reported sightings of Carmen after her disappearance, none were confirmed, and there were no sightings of Diego or Barbara. There has been no evidence of any of their whereabouts since March 1982.",http://charleyproject.org/case/carmen-maria-burhans-garcia,-117.6868098,34.3769802

She has never been heard from again. Less than two weeks later, her estranged husband, Brian Burns, was charged with her murder. Investigators believe he shot her to death, burned her body and spread the ashes. A photo of Brian is posted with this case summary.

Carla was a nursing instructor at Southeastern Illinois College and lived in Marion, Illinois; Brian was a doctor and lived in Harrisburg. They married in 2009, but were in the process of a divorce when Carla disappeared.

Carla had filed for divorce in 2014, citing irreconcilable differences. She later filed multiple petitions for temporary relief and restraining orders, claiming Brian verbally abused her and he feared he would turn violent. She also stated he had taken $63,058, both of their life savings, from their joint bank accounts. Brian, in turn, accused Carla of ""economic blackmail"" and ""verbal harassment"" and claimed he'd stolen two handguns and various documents from him, including his passport.

In September 2016, he was additionally charged with solicitation, aggravated kidnapping and conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping after he allegedly offered to pay an undercover police officer $1,000 to kidnap Mike Henshaw, the prosecutor in his murder case. In 2018, he was convicted and sentenced to twenty years in prison for that crime.

Eight days after Carla went missing, Brian told police she had died in a ""tragic accident"" when she shot herself between the eyes with his 9 mm pistol, and that he burned her body and scattered the ashes on their property. He claimed he had not remembered her death until then, because of the emotional trauma. Brian maintained this story at his trial in December 2019. The prosecution argued Brian had planned Carla's death several days in advance. He was convicted of murder and concealment of a homicidal death in Carla's disappearance.

Carla left behind two sons who live in Texas; she planned on returning to live in Texas after finishing out the semester at Southeastern Illinois College. Her remains have never been located, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/carla-mae-burns,-88.540607,37.7383812

She parked her vehicle in the lot of The Little Bar in the 600 block of Frankfort Avenue during the day. She returned to the location after the game ended.

She was last seen leaning against her black four-door 2000 Dodge Neon with the Ohio license plate number CQY-5786. A witness told authorities that it appeared as if Clemett was having difficulty breathing at the time. She has never been heard from again and her vehicle has not been located.

Clemett did not take any of her personal belongings or additional clothing with her. Her neighbors reported that she never returned to her residence in the 800 block of Starkweather Avenue in the Tremont neighborhood after the game, and her apartment was found locked and undisturbed. There has not been any activity on her bank account or credit cards since her disappearance.

Clemett had pleaded no contest to driving under the influence and was scheduled to be sentenced on June 16, but she did not anticipate a severe sentence and her loved ones don't believe she would have run away to avoid her legal problems. Her family members stated it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning, and they believe that foul play was involved in her case.

Marjorie West,"May 8, 1938","White Gravel, PA",4,White,"3'3""",35 lbs,"Marjorie attended a church service with her family members in Bradford, Pennsylvania during the morning hours of May 8, 1938. Her parents decided to have a Mother's Day picnic afterwards in the White Gravel area, which was a 40-minute drive from Bradford. They drove south along US Route 219, following an old railroad grade from Custer City to Marshburg, Pennsylvania. The Wests entered the White Gravel area from Chapel Fork Road in McKean County.

Marjorie picked wildflowers with her older sister Dorothea later during the day. Dorothea recalled that their parents warned them against walking behind a large boulder near the flowers. She said their father and brother checked the area, but there was a chance that rattlesnakes were hiding near the rock.
Dorothea left Marjorie alone while she spoke to their mother at approximately 3:00 PM. Marjorie disappeared by the time her sister returned to the area. She has never been heard from again. The girls' mother called the police after an initial search of the area by family members produced no evidence as to Marjorie's whereabouts. Police searched with bloodhounds around the rock and down to the road where the scent trail stopped; there near the road were the violets that Marjorie had picked earlier.

Witnesses reported that two vehicles drove past the Wests' picnic site prior to Marjorie's disappearance. The first was going south to Morrison just before three o'clock. The second was going toward Marshburg just after three. Authorities identified the cars and neither was involved in her case.

A taxi driver in Thomas, West Virginia claimed that he saw a girl matching Marjorie's description riding in a dark-colored sedan with an unidentified man. The sighting took place at 11:38 PM on the night of her disappearance. The driver said that the individual asked him where the nearest motel was located. The driver directed him to an establishment across the street, which did not have any vacancies. The man returned and inquired about a local liquor store. The driver instructed him to stop at a bar down the road. The driver identified Marjorie as the man's passenger several days later, but man's identity remains a mystery.

Investigators determined that the approximate travel time along US Route 219 between the White Gravel area and Thomas, West Virginia was eight hours. If the individual abducted Marjorie around 3:00 PM, they would have arrived in Thomas by 11:00 - 11:30 PM that evening. Authorities were unable to confirm the child's identity.

There was speculation that Marjorie was taken to Canada by other family members, while others theorized that she may have fallen down an abandoned oil well near White Gravel. Some people believed that Marjorie may have been abducted and taken somewhere in the south or southwestern United States.
Additional speculation pointed towards the Tennessee Children's Home Society near Memphis, Tennessee. The facility was operated by Georgia Tann, who was initially lauded for placing at-risk children in adoptive homes. Authorities eventually learned that Tann had kidnapped over 1200 young children during the years 1932 through 1951. The majority of victims were abducted from states bordering Tennessee, although some children resided in Connecticut. Judge Camille Kelly approved Tann's custody bids for the majority of the victims. Tann placed most of the children with childless couples in New York City, New York or Los Angeles, California.

None of the theories have been proven and no one has been implicated in Marjorie's disappearance.",https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/7033,-78.7743734,41.826947

Thora Afton Chamberlain,"November 2, 1945","Campbell, CA",14,White,"5'2""",120-125 lbs,"Thora was last seen outside Campbell High School in Campbell, California on November 2, 1945. She had just finished her classes and planned to attend a football game after school.

Her classmates saw her speaking for several minutes to a man in a vehicle on Winchester Boulevard. One of the witnesses said the man was dressed like an ex-serviceman and wanted someone to babysit his sister's children for the afternoon. Thora got into the vehicle with him. She has never been heard from again.

Thomas Henry McMonigle later claimed responsibility for Thora's murder, although his various statements about it differed widely in many details; at various times he claimed he stabbed her, that he shot her, that he strangled her, that she fell out of his car, that her death was accidental, and that he didn't kill her at all.

Photos of McMonigle are posted with this case summary. He had an arrest record dating back to his teens for crimes including assault with intent to commit rape. He immediately became a suspect in Thora's disappearance and fled the area, going to his father's home in Illinois.

On December 6, he returned to California, taking a bus to San Francisco. He attempted suicide on the bus by taking an overdose of sleeping pills, but recovered after treatment at the hospital.

After his discharge from the hospital, McMonigle was arrested by FBI agents. Several of Thora's classmates identified him as the man she was speaking to on the afternoon she disappeared. He was not an ex-serviceman, but admitted having stolen a foot locker from a serviceman which contained the Navy-issue clothes and military medals he was wearing on the day of Thora's disappearance. The foot locker was later found in the garage of McMonigle's home in San Mateo, California.

In one of his statements, McMonigle said he'd shot Thora accidentally while she was in his vehicle and she bled on the car's padding and upholstery, which he ripped out and buried. FBI agents later recovered it from its burial site in a drainage ditch near McMonigle's workplace; it was stained with human blood.

There was also a bullet hole in the door of McMonigle's car, which was consistent with his statement. He said he'd removed the bullet from the door and buried it under a certain tree in his yard; the FBI found it there and determined it had in fact been fired from McMonigle's .32-caliber Colt revolver.

McMonigle gave several different accounts as to how he had disposed of Thora's body. At one point he said he'd thrown Thora's body off a steep 350-foot cliff known as the Devil's Slide, which overlooks Half Moon Bay on the San Mateo County coast.

When police searched the area, they found Thora's two pairs of red and blue socks wedged in two different crevices partway down the cliff face. Her parents identified them.

McMonigle had been working at a construction site at the time of his disappearance, and he got permission from his boss to fill in a nearby ditch with concrete blocks and dirt. When FBI agents dug up the ditch, they found Thora's shoes, schoolbooks and papers, binder and cowbell. McMonigle told investigators he'd buried her clothes in his backyard, but an excavation of the yard turned up nothing; no further trace of Thora was located.

McMonigle was charged with Thora's murder in spite of the fact that her body had never been found. Prosecutors theorized he killed her after she resisted his sexual advances, and her body was carried out to sea after he tossed it off the Devil's Slide. The jury deliberated only 38 minutes before convicting him.

(He also confessed to the murder of a San Francisco, California woman, but authorities decided not to charge him because he was already under sentence of death. At one point he claimed he had killed eleven people, but this could not be verified.)

In his last statement prior to his execution in the gas chamber in 1948, McMonigle retracted all his previous statements and claimed he was completely innocent of any involvement in Thora's disappearance.

Thora's body has never been found. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/36923,-121.9501745,37.2875873

Mary Sue Kitts,"July 1, 1974","Fresno, CA",17,White,"5'1""",100 lbs,"Mary was last seen in Fresno, California sometime during July 1974. She has never been heard from again. Her parents did not report her missing until November of that year. Her disappearance was initially considered to be a runaway case.

The month before Mary went missing, Clarence Ray Allen, Clarence's son Roger, and other accomplices burglarized Fran's Market in Fresno. The burglars stole $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders. Mary was Roger's live-in girlfriend at the time. After the burglary, she told Bryon Schletewitz, whose parents were the owners of Fran's Market, that the Allens had burglarized the store and she had helped cash the money orders.

Schletewitz confronted Roger about this and he admitted he and his father had committed the crime. Clarence was furious when he found out what Mary had done and ordered her murder. An accomplice, Eugene Leland ""Lee"" Furrow, strangled her to death and her body was wrapped up, weighted with stones and dumped in the Friant-Kern Canal.

In 1977, Clarence was convicted of burglarizing Fran's Market and murdering Mary, and sentenced to life in prison. Furrow, who said Clarence threatened to kill him as well if he didn't murder Mary, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder.

After his conviction, Clarence ordered the murders of eight of the witnesses who had testified against him in the Mary trial, including Schletewitz and Schletewitz's father.

In 1980, two hired killers went to Fran's Market and murdered Schletewitz and two teenage store employees who happened to be present. A fourth victim at the store was also shot, but survived. The perpetrators were arrested before they could carry out additional murders.

Clarence was later convicted of three counts of murder and sentenced to death for his role in the crime. His son Kenneth, who supplied ammunition and transportation to the contract killers, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Clarence was executed by lethal injection in January 2006, although his attorneys tried to get his sentence commuted because he was 76 years old and in poor health.

Foul play is suspected in Mary's case due to the circumstances involved. Her remains have never been located.",http://charleyproject.org/case/mary-sue-kitts,-119.7888529,36.7387425
Tiana Neshelle Martin,Jul-03,"Fresno, CA",10,Black/African American,"5'5""",80 lbs,"In 2003, Tiana resided with her 12- and 14-year-old sisters, her aunt, Tamara Lynette Robinson, and Robinson's 2-year-old daughter in an apartment complex in the 4400 block of west Avalon Avenue in Fresno, California. The three girls had moved in with Robinson in 2002, after their mother lost her job and couldn't afford to take care of them any longer.

On the afternoon of September 8, 2003, Robinson asked her sister-in-law to babysit the girls while she ran errands. Tiana's sisters arrived at their aunt's home without Tiana and said she was out of town. That evening, Robinson came to sister-in-law's home, became upset and asked where Tiana was. Her sister-in-law said they should begin searching for her or contact the police.Robinson reported Tiana missing at 1:30 a.m. on September 9, saying she'd last seen her at 7:30 a.m. the previous day. She said Tiana had a history of running away and didn't want to live with her.

Only hours after the report was made, authorities arrested Robinson and charged her with two county of felony corporal injury to a child and one count of child endangerment. Court documents indicated both Tiana's sisters had been severely beaten and one them told her school vice principal Tiana was dead. Police stated publicly that they also suspected Robinson of murdering her missing niece. She was not accused of abusing her own daughter, however.

When interviewed by the police right after her arrest, Robinson admitted Tiana had been missing for months. She said the last time she'd seen her niece was on July 11. She said Tiana caused many problems for her and described her as a problem child and her sisters as liars, and insinuated that one of Tiana's sisters had hurt or killed her after a fight about physical exercises.

Investigators received information from an undisclosed source that Tiana did not disappear in September 2003, but was in fact beaten to death by her aunt in July or August 2003. Her body was allegedly disposed of in a trash bin about a week after her death and would have been taken from there to the American Avenue Landfill on American Avenue and Highway 145 in Fresno.

One of Tiana's sisters said she witnessed the crime and both of them say they were forced to help dispose of the child's remains and clean the apartment of bloodstains. Robinson then allegedly concealed Tiana's disappearance for the rest of the summer.

Tiana had regular doctor's appointments; she missed an appointment on July 7 and the doctor's office was unable to get in touch with Robinson for a week. Robinson finally contacted them on July 14 and said Tiana was back in her mother's care. That same day, Tiana's sisters attended a birthday party without her, something their friends found odd, since the three sisters were always together.

Authorities spent two weeks searching a local landfill for Tiana's remains but did not find them. Over a year after the child was reported missing, Robinson was charged with murdering her. At her trial, both of Tiana's sisters testified against her.

Robinson denied having killed or intentionally harmed her niece, but in 2006, she was convicted of second-degree murder and felony child abuse. Tiana's remains have never been found.",http://charleyproject.org/case/tiana-neshelle-martin,-119.8715917,36.8170794

Ashley Nicole Summers,"July 11, 2007","Cleveland, OH",11,White,"5'5""",130 lbs,"Ashley last seen in Cleveland, Ohio on July 9, 2007. She lived with her great-uncle in the 2100 block of west 96th Street, near Madison Avenue, at the time. She disappeared after an argument, taking all her clothes with her. A month later, she called her mother to say she was okay and not to worry.

In November of that year, Ashley's step-grandmother believes she saw Ashley from her car on West 44th Street. Ashley had her hair cut short and dyed blonde. She disappeared before her step-grandmother could turn the car around.

Authorities believe Ashley left of her own accord, but she hasn't been seen or heard from since 2007 and it's possible she's being held against her will. There was a theory that her case was connected to the disappearance of two other Cleveland teenagers: Amanda Berry, age 16, who disappeared in April 2003, and Georgina DeJesus, age 14, who disappeared in April 2004.

In May 2013, Amanda and Georgina were located safe after Amanda escaped from the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro and called 911. She, Georgina, and another woman, Michelle Knight, who disappeared in 2002 at the age of twenty, had been held captive inside the house for the entire time they were missing.

Kaliyah N Parker,"April 21, 2005","Cleveland, OH",4,Black/African American,"2'4""",34 lbs,"Kaliyah Parker was last seen in Cleveland, Ohio. The last time anyone other than her mother saw her was at her fourth birthday party on April 21. She may have been alive in November 2005 and into 2006.

Her mother, India Parker, gave several conflicting reports to various people who asked about Kaliyah, sometimes claiming she was with relatives or in foster care, or that she had been killed after a bookcase fell on her.

The father of one of India's other children got suspicious of India's story and in December 2011, five years after Kaliyah was last seen, he reported her missing. The police could find no record of the child's supposed death.

India told the police she'd found Kaliyah mysteriously dead in her bed one morning in 2006. She admitted she hadn't reported the death and continued to collect Kaliyah's Social Security benefits for years. She said she left her daughter's body in her bed for a week, then put it in a garbage bag and took it outside for curbside trash pickup.

India had been charged with child endangerment in 2000, but the charge was dropped after she agreed to take parenting classes.

When Kaliyah was born in 2001, India wasn't allowed to take the baby home. Kaliyah's grandmothers as well as a foster mother raised the child for the next two years while India completed a parenting plan. She got custody of her daughter in 2003 and they were monitored for another six months before Children and Family Services closed the file for the family.

In April 2012, India pleaded guilty to evidence tampering and abuse of a corpse and was sentenced to the maximum term of three years in prison. The judge stated he didn't believe her statement that she'd taken Kaliyah's body out with the trash and asked her, at sentencing, whether her daughter was alive.

India repeated she'd put the body in the trash and apologized for her ""lapse in judgement."" She also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of government property in September 2013 and sentenced to sixteen months in prison. She admitted she'd collected $41,000 in benefits for Kaliyah after her daughter died.

Authorities are continuing to investigate Kaliyah's presumed death, but stated they may never find her body and may never be certain how she died.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/13609

Lewis drove away the next morning, and Beverly was seen walking into Medina's business district. Lewis was later stopped by police.

Beverly may have been sighted in January 1957 in El Paso, Texas; a local man saw her photo in the paper in March 1957 and recognized her. The man said she had stopped him on the street and asked for money, giving her name as Beverly. The man gave her $4 and the girl said she planned to rent a budget room on San Francisco Street.

She worked as a professional escort and that night went to an address in Parma, Ohio. At 6:30 p.m., she called the escort service she worked for and said no one had answered the door at the designated address. She has never been heard from again.

The next day, her 1991 Chevrolet Lumina was found in the parking lot of a shopping center on Pearl Road, with her keys inside and $350 in cash in the console. Authorities traced the phone her prospective client used; it was a pay phone at a Cleveland donut shop.

Parisi had worked as an escort for seven years. In January 1997, a few months before her disappearance, she was violently attacked by one of her clients: James Faia, a convicted drug trafficker, allegedly robbed her at gunpoint and tried to kill her by putting a plastic bag over her head. She survived and her assailant was indicted for attempted murder, aggravated robbery and felonious assault.

At the time of Parisi's disappearance, Faia was out on bail awaiting trial. It's unclear whether he had anything to do with her disappearance, however; police could find no evidence that he was involved.

Parisi left behind a live-in boyfriend and two young daughters. She was attending a trade school at the time of her disappearance and hoped to be able to give up escort work and become a fashion buyer upon graduation.

Tiffany Jennifer Papesh,"June 13, 1980","Maple Heights, OH",8,White,"4'0""",58 lbs,"Tiffany Papesh was last seen inside the Convenient Food Mart in her hometown of Maple Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, on June 13, 1980. Tiffany purchased hamburger buns at the store and left at approximately 2:45 p.m. that afternoon.

She disappeared while en route to her family's residence, which was half a block away. Tiffany has never been heard from again. The search for her began at 3:00 p.m., when she had not returned home.

Tiffany's father was at work at the time of her disappearance; he was cleared as a suspect in her case early in the investigation. Tiffany's stepmother, who had raised her since she was four years old, passed a polygraph and was also cleared.

Brandon Lee Flagner, whose given name was Chico Virgilio Tenorio, confessed to Tiffany's rape, murder and dismemberment in while he was imprisoned in Texas in 1983, three years after her disappearance. He was incarcerated for child molestation and burglary.

In interviews with the FBI, Flagner said he abducted Tiffany and drove her to a wooded area by a nearby school. He said he shot her in the head accidentally when she resisted his sexual advances. He stated he ate parts of Tiffany's body and disposed pieces of it in various parts of Ohio.

He also wrote two ministers and an Ohio television station about the murder. He mentioned the scar on Tiffany's knee, which was not generally known to the public at the time.

Flagner ultimately made at least 30 confessions to the crime, but many of his statements contradicted each other. He later retracted all his confessions, claiming he only made the statements because he was about to be released from prison and wanted to stay and get sex offender treatment. He was nonetheless convicted of two counts of aggravated murder and one count of kidnapping in June 1985.

Flagner was sentenced to life in prison for Tiffany's murder and twenty-five years for the kidnapping. He will not be eligible for parole until 2019.

Flagner grew up in Elyria, Ohio, not far from Maple Heights. He was arrested for burglary in 1978 and sentenced to two five-year terms, but paroled after only sixteen months. He was released from prison three months before Tiffany went missing.

He became actively involved in the search for Tiffany and offered to sell t-shirts with the child's picture to raise awareness and funds for the search. The Papesh family had him arrested and the police warned him not to bother them.

After Tiffany's disappearance, Flagner asked his wife and brother to destroy a metal box which was in the trunk of his car. The box contained, among other things, some children's clothing. In November 1980, he told his brother that Tiffany's father had hired him to find the child's killer and that he thought Tiffany's father himself had committed the crime.

It is worth noting that many people believe Flagner to be innocent of involvement in Tiffany's case. The police initially discounted his confessions, saying his statements were inconsistent and there was no evidence to support them. His time card shows that he was at work at Sta-Co in Creston, Ohio, about 40 miles away from Maple Heights, up until half an hour before Tiffany's disappearance on June 13.

Flagner, who converted to Orthodox Judaism while in prison, was convicted in Tiffany's case largely because of his confession and because he has a criminal record for child molestation; he says he molested over 400 young girls, a claim most investigators believe is exaggerated.

He remains in prison, but investigators in Tiffany's case and many members of her own family do not believe Flagner was the responsible party. Tiffany's remains have never been located.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/1861

Butler lived in the 10 block of west Pleasant Avenue with her husband and family at the time of her disappearance.

When questioned by police, Cable's roommate, Jerry Gaston, said she'd moved out to go live with relatives. However, none of Cable's family, who all live out of state, had heard from her, and she always contacted them at Christmastime.

Cable has a minor criminal record and was once ordered into treatment for substance abuse, but hasn't had any contact with law enforcement since 2013. Authorities have classified her disappearance as suspicious, and their main suspect in her case is Gaston.

Everlyse Cabrera,"June 10, 2006","North Las Vegas, Nevada",2,Hispanic / Latina,"2'6""",25 lbs,"verlyse was last seen in North Las Vegas, Nevada on June 10, 2006. She and her younger brother were living with foster parents, Vhee and Manuel Carrascal, in the 6500 block of Diamond Point Court in North Las Vegas.

The Carrascals stated they checked on Everlyse at 1:00 a.m. and she was asleep in her bed. The next time they checked, at 8:00 a.m., she was gone. They theorized that she stood on a chair, unlocked the front door of their home, and wandered out. The Carrascals did not report Everlyse's disappearance to police until noon, four hours after they realized she was missing.

The Carrascals stopped cooperating with police early on in the investigation. Authorities stated that no one outside the foster family remembers having seen Everlyse after May 15, which was the day her biological parents last saw her and almost a month prior to her reported disappearance.

Everlyse's parents, Marlena Olivas and Ernesto Cabrera, filed a lawsuit against the Carrascals and the Clark County, Nevada Department of Family Services (DFS) in September 2006, alleging negligence in supervising and monitoring Everlyse while she was in their custody.

The Carrascals' adult son, who owned and lived in their home, was never licensed or subjected to a criminal background check, which is in violation of the agency's standard procedure. The Carrascals pleaded their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to speak when they were questioned about Everlyse's disappearance in court.

In September 2007, the lawsuit was settled for $300,000. This amount is the maximum payout on the insurance policy provided for the foster parents by Clark County. It releases the Carrascals from any future civil liability. Olivas and Ernesto asked for $2.3 million from Clark County, but this was refused.

On the day Everlyse's parents last saw her, they noticed she had a burn on her hand. They asked for an explanation but got no answer. Curiously, a previous foster child of the Carrascals sustained second- and third-degree burns. Eight hours later, he was finally taken to the emergency room and had to spend the night in the hospital. Vhee claimed he had been burned by hot soup. Neither she nor her husband were accused of abusing the child, but he was removed from their home.

The Carrascals had demanded the immediate removal of several other children placed in their home, leading to concerns from the DFS about their level of commitment to being foster parents. They also failed to complete the required training, but their foster home license was renewed anyway, two months prior to Everlyse's disappearance.

Everlyse's parents lived in El Monte, California at the time of her daughter's disappearance. The DFS got involved with the family after Everlyse's brother tested positive for drugs at birth. In December 2007, Olivas and Ernesto surrendered their parental rights to Everlyse's siblings and allowed them to be adopted by their foster family, with whom they were placed after Everlyse went missing.

The children's biological parents stated their sons had bonded with the foster family and they thought the children would be better off there. Everlyse's parents have not surrendered their rights to her, however.

Everlyse remains missing and the circumstances surrounding her disappearance are unclear. Her foster parents remain the focus of the investigation, but are not being called suspects in her case.

She may have been seen at Simply Tan in the same shopping plaza between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. The business's owner stated she came in, soaking wet, and saying she had lost her wallet, and the owner and two employees tried to help her find it but they were unable to locate it. She has never been heard from again.

Cahill-Shadle had lived in Ferguson Township, Pennsylvania until November 2013, when she moved in with her mother in Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania. In late April 2014, she moved to the State College area to be closer to her three children. She didn't have a permanent address and was staying with a friend and at hotels, including the Quality Inn and the Rodeway Inn.

She also didn't have a cellular phone, credit card, extra clothes or any money when she disappeared, and her loved ones don't believe she would have left of her own accord.

When he woke up on the morning of May 12, his mother was gone but her purse was still inside. She had usually left for work by the time her son woke up, so her absence wasn't unusual. Not realizing anything was wrong, her son went to school.

Cain was reported missing at 1:30 p.m. on May 12. She has never been heard from again. Authorities found bloodstains and drag marks and bloodstains on the porch and walkway of her home. Bloody boot prints were present, along with evidence that someone had tried to clean up inside the house.

At 2:40 p.m., her car was found near the Navy Point bridge and Bayou Grande, a few blocks from her home. There were small drops of blood in the trunk, and the driver's seat was pulled back, indicating someone taller than Cain was the last person to drive the car. The blood in Cain's vehicle and home was identified as hers.

Gary Bernard Breeze, Cain's ex-husband, was charged with her murder in 1992. Photos of Breeze are posted with this case summary.

He allegedly told six people he had killed Cain, giving different stories as to what exactly had happened, and stating he was sure he wouldn't be punished because there was no body. Another of Breeze's ex-wives described him as a violent man, and Cain's cousin testified that two months before she disappeared, Cain was raped by her ex-husband.

Breeze was convicted of second-degree murder in 1993 and sentenced to forty years in prison; he is still incarcerated. He had a prior criminal record for sexual offenses against young boys.

She and Anthony had always had an extremely troubled relationship. Both parties abused drugs and alcohol, there frequent episodes of domestic violence in the home, and they reportedly neglected and abused their children. There were also financial problems.

An extensive search of the area failed to locate Amanda. A pair of child-sized blue socks were located in the street, however; it is unknown if they belonged to Amanda. A photograph of the street corner where Amanda disappeared is posted with this case summary.

Dogs tracked her scent from Larchmont Drive to Oliver Road, to the drive-through at a nearby McDonald's restaurant, then east on Travis Boulevard to the westbound Interstate 80 on-ramp. Authorities believe she was pulled into a vehicle, probably at Larchmont Drive and Salisbury Drive.

Two men have been named as possible suspects in Amanda's case. Authorities announced that Timothy Bindner had a possible connection to her disappearance, as well as the disappearances of Ilene Misheloff, Tara Cossey and Michaela Garecht. A photo of Bindner is posted with this case summary. He maintains his innocence and successfully sued Amanda's hometown of Fairfield, California in 1997 for defamation of character.

Bindner, a married sewage treatment plant worker, came to authorities' attention after he began sending birthday greetings to young girls in the East Bay area. One child's parents contacted authorities and handed over a letter Bindner had written to their daughter. The note was printed backwards and could only be deciphered by holding it up to a mirror. Bindner claimed he sent the cards as a kind gesture because the girls were ""lonely.""

Bindner also visited the Oakmont Cemetery gravesite of Angela Bugay, a five-year-old girl girl who was abducted and murdered in Antioch, California in 1983. A photograph of Bugay is posted with this case summary. Bindner was never considered a suspect in her murder and another man has since been arrested in that case.

For many years Bindner was also considered a suspect in the June 1988 disappearance of Amber Swartz-Garcia from Pinole, California. Bindner approached many of the mothers of missing girls from the East Bay area offering his assistance, including Amber and Michaela's families.

Investigators asked Amber's mother to maintain a quasi-friendship with Bindner in hope of learning if he was connected to any of the girls' cases. She and authorities agreed that Bindner appeared to playing mind games with victims' loved ones and law enforcement.

Many people theorize that Bindner enjoyed taunting families into thinking that he may have been involved in the presumed abductions. He was once arrested for annoying two little girls whom he was trying to lure into his van, but the charges were later dropped. Bindner often drove around in a light blue Dodge van with a license plate that said ""Lov You."" Inside the van was wallpapered with many pictures of children. A photograph of the van is posted with this case summary.

Bindner refers to himself as a ""good Samaritan."" He asked Linda Golston, a reporter for The San Jose Mercury News, to interview him at Oakmont Cemetery at 4:30 a.m. He played his favorite song on her car stereo, ""Jesus, Here's Another Child To Hold."" Bindner told Goldston that he thought of the missing girls as ""his children."" She asked him how he believed the abductions occurred and he said one child was submissive, but another fought back against her assailant. Bindner added that he was ""guessing"" about the girls' reactions.

Bindner wrote a letter to a law enforcement agency in the late 1980s, stating that he believed the next girl who would be abducted from the area would be about nine years old. Michaela disappeared shortly thereafter; she was nine at the time of her abduction. Bindner also sent a holiday card to a profiler for the FBI in 1990. The card depicted an image of a young girl holding up four fingers. Amanda vanished in 1991 at the age of four.

Search dogs traced Amanda and Amber's scent to Bugay's grave. Authorities never had enough evidence to prove Bindner was connected to their cases, although he was known for visiting the cemetery on occasion. Bindner was given a heroism award by the California State Patrol after assisting victims in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake. He has never been charged in any of the cases.

Curtis Dean Anderson, who was convicted of the 2000 kidnapping and molestation of a young California girl, was also mentioned as a possible suspect in Amanda's case. Investigators searched Anderson's mother's residence in June 2001 for evidence linking him to other missing girls' cases, but nothing was located.

In 2009, however, they announced that Anderson had confessed to Amber's murder a month before he died in prison in 2007, and they were closing her case and ending the search for her. Police spent eighteen months investigating his statement and couldn't find any evidence to refute it. He is also considered a suspect in the 1999 disappearance of Karla Rodriguez.

A witness observed Tonetta's abduction approximately half a block from Tonetta's home at approximately 3:00 p.m. A woman on Ruth Street near Hamilton Avenue glanced up the hill and watched Tonetta walking down the street. Several unidentified suspects jumped out of a tan and yellow vehicle with the Tennessee license plate number LKH 920, forcibly pulled Tonetta inside the vehicle and then drove away.

The witness told authorities that she and her husband chased the vehicle and called law enforcement with its license plate number. Tonetta's mother filed a missing child report with authorities eight hours later when her daughter failed to return home from school. The missing child report and the abduction report were not connected for two days.

The plate number of the vehicle involved in the abduction was traced back to Jeffrey Jones. Jones was previously convicted of rape and aggravated sexual assault and served eight years in prison. He was released about a year before Tonetta disappeared. Authorities determined he raped another woman who lived in his apartment complex just two months before Tonetta was last seen.

He died by suicide and his body was found inside his van on March 18, 1989, two days after Tonetta was last seen. The cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. There has been no trace of Tonetta since that time, but there have been rumors that she was forced into prostitution and possibly taken to California.

Tonetta enjoys pizza and fast food items. She liked rap music and the musical artist Bobby Brown at the time of her 1989 disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.

Elinor Carnevale,"August 6, 1969","Lowell, Massachusetts",28,Caucasian / White,"5'5"" - 5'7""
",135 lbs,"Carnevale was last seen in Lowell, Massachusetts on August 6, 1969. She lived with her mother in the 30 block of Royal Street at the time. She'd moved in with her on August 1, leaving her husband and two young children at their residence in the 10 block of Cambridge Street in Chelmsford. She left all her clothing behind and has never been heard from again.

Two days after Carnevale's disappearance, the 1966 sedan she'd just bought was found abandoned in the parking lot of St. John's Hospital in Lowell. It had been there for days, the keys were in the ignition, and Carnevale's purse and wallet, containing $4, was on the front seat.

Carnevale disappeared less than a week after receiving a $3,500 settlement for a car accident. She spent most of the money over the next few days, including paying $1,750 for her new car, and left the balance, $400, behind at home.

Carnevale is described as a devoted mother who regularly visited her children even after moving out of their house. She dated other men after separating from her husband, and one of the man she was seeing was asked to take a polygraph and passed. She has a history of turning to professional people for help and treatment.

Carnevale's husband stated she called him on the evening of August 18, twelve days after her disappearance, and said she was staying at a hotel in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The police have been unable to verify this. A friend believed she might have left of her own accord, stating Carnevale had said she was ""discouraged"" and wanted to go to California or Ohio, but her family discounted this theory because they didn't think she would have left her children. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/elinor-carnevale,-71.3204633,42.6322881

Mary Virginia Carpenter,"June 1, 1948","Denton, Texas",21,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",120 lb,"Carpenter was last seen in Denton, Texas on June 1, 1948. She left her home in Texarkana, Texas and took a train to Denton, six hours away. She packed a brown steamer trunk, a matching makeup case and a black pasteboard hatbox. At the station she took a taxicab to Texas State College for Women (TSCW), now called Texas Women's University. She was planning to complete a summer term there.

Carpenter had previously attended the University of Arkansas and studied journalism, but transferred to the TSCW because she'd decided to enter into a career in the sciences instead; she aspired to a career as laboratory technician.

Carpenter first enrolled in the TSCW for the 1945-46 school year, then took a break from school to help her sick mother and save up money to pay for her education. She attended Texarkana Junior College for a time, then enrolled in the 1948 summer term at TSCW. She planned to begin training there as laboratory technician in the autumn, but disappeared just before the summer term began.

The cab driver, Edgar Ray ""Jack"" Zachary, later stated he stopped in front of Brackenridge Hall at 9:00 p.m. and Carpenter gave the driver a ticket for her trunk and paid him a dollar so he would fetch it for her from the train station the next day.

After getting out of the cab, Zachary said, Carpenter approached two young men standing near a yellow or cream-colored convertible car, possibly a Pontiac. One of the men was tall and the other is described as ""chunky."" Carpenter appeared to know them and began to speak to them, and Zachary drove away. She never checked into her dormitory, Brackenridge Hall, and has never been heard from again.

Some of Carpenter's former boyfriends stated she became infatuated easily and speculated she ran away with a lover, but her family did not believe she would have left without telling them. She had previously been engaged, but broke off the relationship just weeks prior to the wedding.

Carpenter's boyfriend passed a polygraph in connection with her disappearance, but authorities learned Zachary had a record for petty crimes and a reputation for being abusive. He was charged with attempted rape in 1957, but the charge was dropped after the victim asked authorities not to prosecute.

Zachary's wife stated he had been home with her from 10:00 p.m. onwards on June 1, but ten years after Carpenter's disappearance, his wife told police she had lied to them and her husband had not actually arrived home until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. on June 2. Zachary died in 1984. He was never charged in connection with Carpenter's case, but he remains a suspect, although he passed two polygraphs in her case.

In the winter and spring of 1946, five young people were murdered in lovers' lanes in Carpenter's hometown of Texarkana. The crimes are believed to have all been committed by the same person. The murderer was never caught and became known as the Texarkana Phantom Killer.

Carpenter was actually acquainted with three of the killer's victims. Authorities investigated to see if there was a link between her disappearance and the Texarkana slayings, but they found no evidence to support this theory.

In 1998, authorities received a tip that two men had raped and killed Carpenter shortly after her disappearance and buried her body in a dam at a stock tank near the Texas Women's University campus. The suspects were both deceased by 1998 and were not publicly identified. Authorities searched the dam after receiving the information, but uncovered no evidence.

Numerous leads and possible sightings of Carpenter have surfaced throughout the decades since her disappearance, but no evidence has been uncovered and none of the accounts have been proven. Her father died prior to her disappearance and her mother died in 1980, and she has no siblings, but three of her cousins still hope to get answers in her case.

Carpenter was declared legally dead in 1955. Her disappearance remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/mary-virginia-carpenter,-97.1273176,33.2266887
Jana Carpenter-Koklich,"August 20, 2001","Lakewood, California",41,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",130 lbs,"Jana was last seen by her friends after an Eric Clapton concert on August 17, 2001. Her husband, Bruce Koklich, told authorities that his wife returned to their home in the 2200 block of Lewis Street in Lakewood, California late that evening. A photo of Bruce is posted with this case summary. Jana's friends stated that she did not drink alcohol during the concert, as she had an early morning appointment with her personal trainer on August 18.

Jana's trainer said that she never called to cancel the appointment and never arrived as scheduled. She had not missed an appointment with her trainer in two years. Her mother said that she called Jana during the day on August 18 and left several messages on her answering machine at home, but Jana never returned the calls, which was very uncharacteristic of her.

Jana and Bruce worked together as realtors with RE/MAX International Inc.'s Seal Beach Office in California. Bruce claimed that Jana was extremely busy from August 18 - 20 and overlooked the calls and appointment with her trainer. He said that he last saw his wife when he departed from their residence between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m. on August 20.

Bruce said he looked at several properties and arrived at their office in the 3900 block of Atlantic Avenue at approximately 8:30 a.m. He said he attended a funeral from 9:30 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. when he returned to the office.

Bruce stated he became concerned about Jana when she did not arrive at work by 11:00 a.m. and called her cellular phone, which she normally kept turned off, and their residence. He drove to their home after she failed to answer his call; a coworker insisted on accompanying them and noticed Bruce had to deactivate the burglar alarm before going inside. They realized Jana was missing.

Bruce said he summoned an unidentified friend from the Long Beach Police Department and called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department at approximately 3:00 p.m.

An extensive search produced no evidence as to Jana's whereabouts. Her white 1996 Nissan Pathfinder SUV remained missing until August 27, when authorities discovered it was parked in a vacant garage in the 2400 block of California Avenue in the Signal Hill area of Long Beach, California, approximately four miles from the Kokliches' residence, in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. The backseat of the vehicle was soaked in her blood.

A group of teenagers said they found the SUV unlocked and abandoned at approximately 8:00 a.m. on August 20, with the front windows rolled down and Jana's purse, cellular phone, keys, and a gun lying in plain sight. They took it for a joyride and also rifled through Jana's personal belongings in the vehicle, including her cellular phone, purse and wallet.

The teens threw Jana's purse and phone on top of an apartment building; both were later recovered. They sold the gun. They did not realize the SUV was involved in a possible murder investigation until a week later, when they came forward with their evidence.

A local minister advertised for the return of the gun, no questions asked, for a $100 reward, and someone gave it to him anonymously. He turned it over to the police.

Bruce and Jana's employees stated that they did not believe Bruce was connected to Jana's case. They described the the couple's marriage as a good relationship and said he would never have harmed his wife.

Bruce said a group of his co-workers searched the surrounding areas for signs of Jana on August 20 and spoke to a witness who claimed to have seen a woman in the back of an SUV earlier in the day. Authorities said they were unable to locate the witness for questioning. Bruce also stated that he believed Jana may have been the victim of a possible carjacking, a scenario investigators dismissed.

Bruce had two polygraph examinations scheduled with authorities, but he never arrived for either appointment. He stated that his attorney and friends in law enforcement recommended he avoid the lie detector tests, calling them unreliable.

Jana's family said that it's extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her father, former California Democratic state senator Paul Carpenter, was ill with prostate cancer and died in late January 2002.

Jana was very close to both of her parents, who were divorced; she was their only child. Jana's stepmother said that she and Jana's father believed that Jana had been murdered sometime after August 17. They pretended to support Bruce publicly until December 2001 in the hopes that he would divulge information concerning Jana's whereabouts.

Carpenter told reporters in 2001 that he believed Bruce murdered Jana because she wanted a divorce and he did not want to split their marital assets. He would have lost 51% of their jointly owned business in a divorce. He had also taken out a $1 million insurance policy on her life.

Bruce was arrested and charged with Jana's murder on January 31, 2002. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in court in early February 2002. Authorities said that a small amount of Jana's blood was discovered in the bedroom of the couple's residence, and a pillow and sheet were missing; they believe Bruce shot her there.

According to prosecutors, Bruce had visited prostitutes throughout his marriage and didn't support Jana's wish to adopt a child. After her disappearance he solicited several female acquaintances for sex, including his own eighteen-year-old niece; he asked her to model Jana's underwear and invited her to live with him.

The trial began in February 2003, but the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared in March. A new trial began and Bruce was convicted of second-degree murder in October 2003. He was sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison.

Jana's body has never been located, and authorities said that they have not located any evidence to suggest that it ever will be. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/jana-carpenter-koklich,-118.1339563,33.8536269

Bianca Zannette Carrasco,"May 1, 2016","San Antonio, Texas",29,Hispanic / Latina,"5'1""",125 lbs,"Bianca was last seen in the 16000 block of Walnut Creek Drive in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2016. Her husband, Joe ""Daniel"" Carrasco, said they got into an argument and he took their youngest child and left in his truck to go to work. He stated that after he left, Bianca left home on foot, leaving their other two children home alone, and he passed her in his truck as she walked down the street.

She has never been heard from again. Her phone has been turned off since 10:22 p.m. on May 1, which is completely uncharacteristic of her behavior; she never turned it off.

Bianca and Daniel had married after she got pregnant when she was eighteen years old; he's eleven years older and had previously been married to her aunt. Although they had three children over the next eleven years, their relationship was rocky and her family said Daniel tried to keep Bianca isolated from them. She and her mother were estranged at the time of her disappearance and hadn't spoken to each other in about five years.

Bianca studied at Odessa College and eventually graduated from the Galen College of Nursing in October 2015. She was working as a registered nurse at an oncologist's office when she went missing, and after she graduated nursing school she decided to divorce and immediately changed her relationship status on her Facebook profile from ""married"" to ""divorced.""

The Carrascos were still living together, but Bianca was casually seeing other men, a fact Daniel apparently discovered by looking through her phone. A few days before she disappeared, Bianca texted her sister saying, ""Daniel emptied the account and opened another account without my name on it, so I have no access to money except my credit card which is almost at the limit. I will not be controlled by a man and money.""

At 2:00 p.m. on the day she went missing she spoke to her sister for the last time and spoke about going to see a lawyer and about child custody issues. After her disappearance, Daniel didn't want to report her missing because he thought she had left voluntarily, but her sister insisted.

Police have investigated both Daniel and one of the men Bianca was seeing, but nobody has been named as a suspect in her case. Foul play is possible in Bianca's disappearance; her loved ones don't believe she would have walked out of her life and they describe her as a loving and responsible parent who wouldn't have left her children alone as Daniel claims she did.

Ylenia Maria Sole Carrisi,"January 6, 1994","New Orleans, Louisiana",23,Caucasian / White,"5'9""",120 lbs,"Carrisi was touring Central America and North America when she arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1993. She had gone with her parents on a trip to the city then decided to stay after the vacation was over and her parents returned to Italy.

At first she traveled to Florida, left a few days later, after telling her parents she feared two men in Florida were trying to drug and kill her. She traveled to Belize and Mexico before going back to New Orleans.

Carrisi, who speaks fluent English, immersed herself in the street culture there and kept company with street musicians and homeless people. She painted and took notes about the people she met, stating she planned to write a book, possibly a novel, about her experiences. Her father believes she may have been using drugs during this period.

At the time of her disappearance, Carrisi was staying in the LeDale, a cheap hotel in the 700 block of St. Charles Avenue, five blocks from the French Quarter, with 54-year-old Alexander Masakela (often spelled ""Maskela""), a street musician who had performed in several countries in Europe. She checked in on December 31, the week before she disappeared.

Masakela said they slept in separate beds during the time they shared the hotel room and she refused to have a sexual relationship with him in spite of his urgings. He had a history of drug use and sexual violence as well as a reputation as a guru. Carrisi seemed fascinated by him. She referred to him as ""my master"" and said he had opened ""completely new intellectual horizons"" for her.

Carrisi was last seen in the city's French Quarter area on January 6, 1994. Her parents, who last heard from her on New Years' Day, reported her missing on January 18. They traveled to Louisiana shortly afterwards to assist in the search efforts.

No evidence regarding Carrisi's whereabouts was discovered. Most of her personal belongings, including her passport, backpack, clothing, camera, luggage and notebooks, were left behind at the hotel.

Masakela showed Carrisi's passport to the hotel staff after her disappearance and attempted to use her traveler's checks to pay the bill from their room, but the checks were refused because they were unsigned, and he was evicted. He told police he did not know Carrisi's whereabouts, but believed she was all right. He was arrested on January 31 after a former girlfriend claimed he had raped her, but released for lack of evidence after less than two weeks.

The only other possible lead was a security guard who saw a woman jump into the Mississippi River near the Aquarium of the Americas at 11:30 p.m. on January 6, the day Carrisi was last seen.

Prior to jumping, the woman was acting strangely and said, ""I belong in the water."" She swam for approximately 100 yards, began to struggle against the current and the wake from a passing boat, screamed for help, and then sank. She fit Carrisi's general physical description and was wearing similar, but not identical, clothing. It has never been established that the person was in fact Carrisi, but many authorities in New Orleans believe it was her.

Not everyone believes Carrisi is dead, however. No trace of her remains were found in the river, but it's possible she was washed into the Gulf of Mexico and out to sea. Since January 1994 there have been many reported sightings of her in the United States, Italy and elsewhere in Europe, even more than a decade after her disappearance. None of the sightings have been confirmed and Carrisi continues to be listed as a missing person.

Carrisi studied literature at King's College in London and earned excellent grades before she took a break from her studies to travel. She played a role in an Italian film in 1983, and in 1989 she was the letter-turner on the television show La Ruota de Fortuna, the Italian version of Wheel of Fortune. As a result, she was something of a celebrity in her native country.

She was born in rural Cellino San Marco in the region of Apulia in southeast Italy and comes from a performing family: her parents were popular entertainers in Italy in 1994, her maternal grandparents and maternal aunt were all film actors, and her two younger sisters have both appeared on Italian reality television. She also a younger brother.

Carrisi's American-born mother has since returned to the United States, but her father still lives in Italy. Members of her family are divided in their opinions to whether she is still alive. Her case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/ylenia-maria-sole-carrisi,-90.0653954,29.9584651
Brenda Kay Carroll,"December 27, 2017","Knoxville, Tennessee",45,Caucasian / White,"5'1""",140 lbs - 160 lbs,"Carroll was last seen on December 27, 2017.

Carroll messaged a relative on January 1, saying she needed money for food and cigarettes, but no one in her family has heard from her since then, and no one has actually seen her or Drane since December 27. Drane's vehicle was located in Tennessee on January 21, 2018, with all her belongings, including her identification, Social Security card and debit cards, inside it.

One of Drane and Carroll's associates, William Inklebarger, also disappeared on December 27. The three of them had lived together at an apartment on Linden Avenue in East Knoxville, but Inklebarger moved out in December after the residence lost power. All three have ""deep drug connections"" and lived transient lifestyles, with no permanent address. Carroll has a history of drug abuse, particularly opioids and crack cocaine.

Two years later, Carroll's 1973 car was found abandoned about a hundred miles away in the parking lot of the Flagship Apartments in the 900 block of Baylor, near Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Based on a flier found under the car windshield, authorities determined it had been parked there since October 1975, three months after Carroll disappeared. There was nothing in the car to indicate her whereabouts, but she had several friends in Waco.

On December 20, the car was found abandoned on State Road 62 in Parrish, Florida. There was no sign of either of the women.

Moriarty was reported missing on January 27 and Carter was reported missing on January 29. Moriarty left her Bradenton, Florida apartment intact, with Christmas decorations and unopened gifts inside.

The rest of her body hasn't been located and authorities aren't sure what caused her death or how her leg was severed. She was 38 years old when she died.

Carter's husband died in 2005 and she began seeing Moriarty in 2009. Carter's daughter described the relationship as ""passionate and volatile"" and said the two women frequently argued. She hasn't used her financial accounts or her phone since she went missing.

Anne Simpson,"September 26, 2004",Ingoldmells,60,Caucasian / White,,,"Anne, who was 60 at the time of her disappearance, lived with her long-term partner Anthony Rogers, known locally as Tom Rogers.

The weekend she disappeared, she was visited by one of her daughters, Josie Hill, and her grandchildren.

After waving the family off back to their home in Leicester, she went for a drink by herself at The Bell Inn.

It is reported that Mr Rogers heard Miss Simpson return to the caravan they shared at 8.30pm.

She went to her room, as the couple had separate bedrooms, and at about 11pm he heard her leave the caravan.

He awoke the next morning to find no sign of his partner and reported her missing.

She had left behind her handbag, medication and belongings.

In 2012, a 62-year-old man living in Devon was arrested in connection with Anne's disappearance.

At around the same time, Lincolnshire Police received an anonymous call from a man who was traced to a phone box in the Wigston area of Leicestershire.

As a result, underwater search teams scoured a lake at Lakeside Caravan Park in Sutton on Sea.

After four days, the search was called off.

No one has ever been charged in connection with Anne's disappearance.

Dorothy May Caylor,"June 12, 1985","Concord, California",41,Caucasian / White,"5'9""",190 lbs,"Dorothy was married to Jule Caylor, an entomologist and aerial photography specialist, in 1985. Jule was often out of town for work-related reasons and Dorothy was alone at their Concord, California residence much of the time.

Her sister told authorities that Jule was allegedly abusive towards Dorothy. She cited a report of domestic violence at Thanksgiving 1981, an incident that was investigated by law enforcement. Jule had hit Dorothy in the face with a typing stand while they were arguing and she drove herself to the hospital for stitches. No charges were filed against anyone in the matter, as Jule claimed Dorothy threatened him with a pair of scissors and he hit her in self-defense.

Dorothy's sister stated that there were numerous problems in the Caylors' marriage, an allegation that Jule denies. He said that the only difficulties in the relationship revolved around his wife's mental health issues. Dorothy's friends say Jule was repeatedly unfaithful to her. He had proposed marriage to a coworker six months before Dorothy's disappearance, and they purchased wedding rings.

Dorothy joined a support group for battered women in early 1985. She was attempting to regain her self-confidence and reportedly planned to divorce Jule. Dorothy opened her own bank account, applied for credit cards in her own name, and rented a post office box. She also asked a friend to keep a locked file cabinet with her important documents. Included in the cabinet was a $5,000 cashier's check, which Dorothy had inherited and kept secret from Jule. The check was due to expire in a few months.

Jule announced that he accepted a new position in Utah with the United States Department Of Forestry in June 1985. Dorothy's family members said that she planned to stay in Concord. She told Jule she wanted a divorce, and they agreed that she would pay him for his half of the house and when he went to Utah, she would own the house in Concord. She packed up Jule's possessions and put them in storage. Dorothy told family members at the time that Jule threatened her, but he denies this.

Jule told authorities that his wife packed an overnight bag and told him she was visiting a friend in California on June 12, 1985. Jule said that he drove Dorothy to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station in Pleasant Hill later that day and watched her walk inside the building. She has never been heard from again. Jule said she was carrying her bag and a turquoise leather purse when she disappeared; the purse contained several items including Dorothy's medical card and a bee-sting kit.

Jule worked in San Francisco on June 13. He said that he found Dorothy's blue 1963 Volkswagen Beetle parked next to his vehicle at the BART station upon his return to Pleasant Hill later in the day.

Her purse was inside her car, along with her driver's license, a current Diablo Valley College student identification card, $30 in cash, library card, and monogrammed off-white leather billfold, but there was no sign of her at the scene. The bee-sting kit was missing. Dorothy's loved ones say it would be uncharacteristic of her to leave her purse behind if she went anywhere.

Jule claimed that he left a note for his wife on her vehicle, hid her purse under the seat, locked the doors, and moved the car so she would not receive a parking ticket. He told investigators that the Beetle remained in its spot on June 14 and he moved the car again.

Authorities stated that the note Jule wrote began in an affectionate manner, saying he was worried about her, then accused Dorothy of messing up Jule's life by refusing to sign loan papers. There was a postscript wherein Jule maintained that it was Dorothy's idea, not his, for him to seek out other women.

Jule reported Dorothy as a missing person to authorities on June 17, five days after her disappearance, after a neighbor urged him to do so, although he said Dorothy was not supposed to return home until June 24. He relocated to Utah less than two weeks later.

Jule packed the majority of Dorothy's belongings inside their California residence prior to his move, repainted the inside of the house, and put it up for rent. He signed the rent contract on June 7, five days before he last saw Dorothy, although he told her loved ones that he was forced to put the house up for rent because her signature was required to sell it.

Dorothy's loved ones became concerned for her safety when she failed to contact anyone. She never claimed any of the money she saved in her bank account. Jule never had Dorothy declared legally deceased, but when he retired, he filed for divorce from her on grounds of desertion.

A judge granted the divorce and awarded all the marital property to Jule, but Dorothy's sister, Diane Rusnak, filed a lawsuit and the divorce was set aside. The Utah judge subsequently ruled that Dorothy was dead at the time Jule sought the divorce, so there was no marriage to dissolve.

After Dorothy's disappearance, Jule wrote a letter to his new fiancee, saying he had made a ""Herculean effort"" to be with her which she might not understand, and that he would do anything for her, even commit murder.

In 1988, the police received a letter postmarked Gary, Indiana which accused Jule of murdering Dorothy. The letter stated Jule had beaten Dorothy to death with a tire iron and buried her body under a birch tree in a remote area of Concord where new homes were being built. A map to the supposed burial location was included with the letter.

Authorities determined that the DNA from saliva on the stamp and envelope flap has male characteristics, but they have been unable to match it anyone. A document examiner believes the letter's handwriting is similar to Jule's, but no definitive match has been made in that area either. The author of the letter has never been identified.

Joan Morris, a reporter for The Contra Costa Times, interviewed Jule during the summer of 2001, 16 years after Dorothy vanished. Jule told Morris that he forgot about his wife's disappearance, saying that he assumed Dorothy was deceased. He now lives in Utah. He attempted to run for the state legislature, but withdrew his candidacy after party members learned the police were investigating Dorothy's disappearance.

Jule changed his version of his wife's 1985 disappearance when she spoke to Morris. He now claims that he never drove Dorothy to the BART station in Pleasant Hill and said he thought she drove herself.

Dorothy was born in Chardon, Ohio. She is described as a very religious Catholic who loved to read and write. She attended secretarial school after graduating high school and got a job as a legal secretary. She met Jule in 1970. He was married at the time and had a child, but Dorothy did not know this until after she had dated him for several months. Jule divorced his wife to marry Dorothy in 1975.

Concord authorities reopened Dorothy's case in August 2001 and are hoping to uncover new leads in her disappearance. In December 2005, they requested a warrant to search Dorothy and Jule's former home. Court documents indicate that authorities believe Jule murdered his wife, but there is insufficient evidence to charge him as of yet. The search turned up no physical evidence.

Rusnak has filed a lawsuit against Jule; She requested that Dorothy be declared legally dead and Rusnak be appointed executor of her estate. A judge found evidence that Dorothy was deceased, but the lawsuit has been stalled pending the outcome of the police investigation into her disappearance.

No charges have been filed against anyone in Dorothy's case.",http://charleyproject.org/case/dorothy-may-caylor,-122.0283378,37.9786636
Nicole Sherese Cearo,"March 3, 2009","Seattle, Washington",20,African American / Black,"5'3""",170 lbs,"Cearo was last seen in Seattle, Washington on March 30, 2009. On March 28, she was arrested for violating a no-contact order involving her boyfriend, Roosevelt Montgomery Jr.

Cearo had recently been evicted from her apartment and had moved in with Montgomery, even though he had a restraining order against her. He picked her up from the King County Jail on March 30. After getting out of jail, Cearo went to go visit her mother. She left her mother's house with Montgomery.

Cearo visited various friends after she left her mother's house, visibly bruised on her face, acting scared and asking for money. She was seen at a club in the Skyway area that night, without Montgomery. He called her on her cellular phone, demanding to know where she was, and Cearo was last seen getting into his vehicle with him next to the club. There were multiple statements that she was shot to death later that night, but police were unable to confirm this.

Cearo's pastor, a friend of her family, reported her missing a few days later. Her mother had wanted to notify the police of Cearo's disappearance, but didn't want to meet with them because she had outstanding warrants, so she asked the pastor to do it.

Cearo received monthly public assistance checks which were held by her pastor, and he became concerned after she failed to pick up her check for April. Authorities believe she was the victim of a homicide.

On April 9, Montgomery was arrested driving a stolen brand new white Ford F-250 pickup truck. He had stolen the truck on the morning of March 30 and drove Cearo around in it the day she disappeared. When the police asked him about Cearo, he said he didn't know her whereabouts and had himself been looking for her.

When the stolen truck was returned to its owner, it had $20,000 worth of damage to it and was full of trash and items that didn't belong to the owner, including Cearo's birth certificate, Social Security card and homework. The exterior was covered in mud and it appeared the truck had been driven offroad.

Montgomery subsequently pleaded guilty to auto theft. Police believe the truck may have been involved in Cearo's murder, and they processed it for evidence and took photographs, but by the time they got to it, the owner had taken it to the body shop and it had been repaired and extensively cleaned.

Montgomery suggested Timothy White Sr. was involved in Cearo's case. White had dated her occasionally, something that had lead to violence between him and Montgomery because the two men were in rival gangs.

However, police determined White was in jail on drug charges when Cearo disappeared. White stated Cearo had been to visit him in jail prior to her disappearance, and she was visibly bruised and stated Montgomery had beaten her.

Montgomery is described as a career criminal with at least 33 prior arrests for offenses such as theft, domestic violence, child abuse and possession of a stolen vehicle; police considered him armed and dangerous.

He allegedly bragged about killing Cearo and dumping her body in the Seward Park area of Seattle, but he hasn't been charged in her disappearance due to lack of evidence. He still lives in the Seattle area, but his gang stated they no longer associated with him and didn't consider him to be a member anymore.

Cearo's public assistance was discontinued in June 2009 and she has made no attempt to reinstate it. She hasn't used her Social Security number since her disappearance, and all calls to her cellular phone go straight to voice mail. She was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved to the Seattle area as a child, after her father was imprisoned. She grew up in the foster care system.

Cearo has a minor criminal record for possession of alcohol by a minor and driving without a license or insurance. After her disappearance, she missed a court hearing in a domestic violence case and a warrant was issued for her arrest.

Investigators have searched for her body, without result. Cearo's disappearance remains unsolved and foul play is suspected.",http://charleyproject.org/case/nicole-sherese-cearo,-122.3320708,47.6062095
Joliet Elizabeth Cedano,"September 11, 2006","Palmdale, California",4 Months,Hispanic / Latina ; Caucasian / White,"1'11""",10 lbs,"Joliet disappeared from Palmdale, California on September 11, 2006. She was with her foster mother at William J. McAdam Park at at 30th Street East and Avenue R when she was abducted by a Hispanic male. The abductor fled with Joliet in a red or maroon 1989 Buick Regal with the license plate number 2MFC968.

Authorities arrested the male kidnapping suspect, Jose Martinez, at 6:00 p.m. that same day, and charged him with child stealing. He did not have Joliet with him when he was apprehended. He told police he gave the baby to her biological mother, Maria Ayala. Joliet had been taken from her mother at birth because she was born addicted to narcotics.

A photograph and vital statistics for Ayala are posted with this case summary. A felony warrant for kidnapping was issued for her on September 12, 2006.

Joliet and Ayala may be traveling in a black 2000 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck with the California license plate number 7D92423, or a blue four-door 1995 Mercury Marquis with the license plate number 5RSK813. Photographs of both vehicles are posted with this case summary.

A photo of Ayala is posted with this case summary. Her date of birth is January 5, 1963, making her 44 years old at the time of Joliet's abduction. She's described as Hispanic, 5'5 and 150 pounds, with blonde or brown hair and brown eyes. Ayala may use the last names Cedano and/or Cruz-Cena. She has a tattoo on her left ankle.

Joliet and Ayala may be in Mexico. The child's whereabouts are unknown and her case remains unsolved.

Some agencies state Joliet was abducted from Lake Los Angeles, California.

Lola Ada Celli,"February 23, 1946","Grandview Heights, Ohio",24,Caucasian / White,"5'4""",115 lbs,"Celli was last seen leaving her parents' Grandview Heights, Ohio home on February 23, 1946. She was going to take a bus to downtown Columbus, Ohio to buy nylon stockings. Celli apparently never made it to the bus stop down the street from her home. She never been heard from again.

Celli was born in a village in southern Italy and moved to the United States with her family at the age of nine. She is a graduate of Ohio State University, where she was an honors student and a member of the Spanish Club, the French Club and the Education Council. She can speak five languages. She taught home economics at West Mansfield High School in 1946.

At the time she disappeared, she was visiting her parents' home for the President's Day holiday weekend. Her loved ones stated she was in good physical and mental health, didn't drink alcohol or smoke, and wasn't dating anyone at the time she disappeared. They did not believe she had left of her own accord.

Authorities initially believed Celli suffered an amnesiac episode which caused her disappearance, but no evidence has been located to support this. Her family always maintained she was abducted.

A witness reported seeing a woman arguing with a man in a car along Olentangy River Road on the day of her disappearance. The woman resembled Celli and was wearing similar clothes. During the argument, a red shoe was thrown or fell from the vehicle, described as a red Dodge coupe with a broken window. Authorities launched a massive search of the area, but were unable to find the shoe or any other other evidence.

That same day, a man driving a red coupe with a broken window stopped for gas at a station on north High Street, about a mile from Olentangy River Road. The man had a woman in the car with him and the station attendant heard him tell her to ""be quiet."" He bought $2 worth of gas, paid with a $5 bill and drove away without waiting for his change.

In 1956, the Grandview Heights chief of police claimed the Celli case was ""closed"" because the marshal of Marble Cliff, Ohio had told him her whereabouts. The police chief said Celli was alive and her disappearance was not a criminal matter. Celli's family stated they didn't believe this information and added that the police chief had not been in touch with them since August 1946, six months after her disappearance.

Celli's father died in 1958 and her mother in 1985. Her case has puzzled the Grandview Heights police department for years. It is still an open investigation.",http://charleyproject.org/case/lola-ada-celli,-83.0407403,39.9797863
Kaya Marie Centeno,"June 1, 2010","Rohnert Park, California",8,Caucasian / White,"3'0""",50 lbs,"Kaya was last seen in Rohnert Park, California sometime between mid-2010 and mid-2012. The exact circumstances of her disappearance are unclear, as the authorities did not learn she was missing until 2020.

In July 2020, the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety was contacted by Child Protective Services (CPS) about possible child abuse that had happened in their city. CPS had been in contact with the authorities in Mexico about two victims, a 17-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, who had been taken into protective custody due to alleged abuse by their adoptive parents, Gina Michelle Centeno and Jose Anthony Centeno.

The two children had been brought to Mexico from Rohnert Park about a year and a half earlier to live with extended family. Both of them stated they had been physically, sexually and emotionally abused over an eight- to ten-year time period. They made references to their older sister Kaya, who used to live with them in Rohnert Park but had disappeared about eight or ten years earlier.

Kaya and her two younger siblings had been adopted by Gina and Jose in 2008. Kaya had been enrolled in John Reed Elementary School in Rohnert Park, but in her second-grade year, 2010-2011, she was withdrawn in order to be homeschooled. At some point not long afterwards, she disappeared.

Police obtained search warrants for the Rohnert Park residence where Kaya's siblings alleged the abuse took place. They found evidence to corroborate the children's statements and subsequently arrested Gina and Jose for aggravated kidnapping in Kaya's case and kidnapping, torture, and various sex offenses in the case of her two siblings.

The two suspects are awaiting trial. Kaya's whereabouts remain unknown.

Chelsey Nicole Chaffin,"May 26, 2019","Stillwater, Oklahoma",29,Native American,"5'3""",160 lbs - 170 lbs,"Chaffin was last seen in Stillwater, Oklahoma on May 25, 2019. She and her fiance had had a fight on May 24, she moved out of their home and into a residence near east 32nd Avenue and Fairgrounds Road a day earlier; the house was owned by Earl Oswalt Jr., who worked with Chaffin at a tile company, Armstrong Industries. After her disappearance, Oswalt claimed she left with an unknown man, leaving her dog behind.

A photo of Oswalt is posted with this case summary. In June, he was arrested and charged with Chaffin's murder. He is a registered sex offender who had been paroled in 2017 after serving twenty years of a sixty-year sentence for rape in the first degree. Chaffin's fiance stated he believed Oswalt and Chaffin were lovers and that she did not know about his background.

Oswalt confessed that he'd killed Chaffin during the early morning hours of May 26. He said he, Chaffin and another resident of the house had been drinking, and at some point Chaffin got angry and threatened the roommate. Oswalt then grabbed her from behind by the throat, and she hit him in the head and walked out of the room. When she came back she was naked. He punched her in the face, and he couldn't remember what else he did to her, but she died. He and the roommate then wrapped Chaffin's nude body in a red blanket and dumped it off a bridge into the Cimarron River at 1:00 a.m. the next day.

The roommate whom Oswalt said had helped dispose of the body stated she wasn't there at the time of Chaffin's murder. She said Oswalt picked her up, and he was covered in blood and his right hand was extremely swollen. When they went to the house, Chaffin was naked and lying on her back, bleeding from the nose, and she had marks on her neck.

Oswalt is awaiting trial for second-degree murder. Chaffin's body has never been found, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/chelsey-nicole-chaffin,-97.0583681,36.1156071

Chamblen was driving her red 1990 Toyota Corolla station wagon with the Oregon license plate number QMV-062. The vehicle's right rear fender was damaged at the time. An image of the car is posted with this case summary. Chamblen has never been heard from again.

Hunters discovered Chamblen's station wagon abandoned in November 2000, nearly one month after she disappeared. The vehicle was parked near a ravine in the Glen Creek area, which is several miles from the Douglas County/Coos County, Oregon line. There was no sign of Chamblen at the scene.

A search of the surrounding rough terrain produced no clues as to her whereabouts. Chamblen's family members believe that she would not have driven to the location unless she was assisting someone. Authorities are uncertain if she drove her vehicle herself or if someone else parked her car in the area.

Investigators said that Chamblen was showing symptoms of mild memory loss at the time of her disappearance. They said it was possible that she became disoriented and wandered away from her station wagon.

Chamblen's loved ones said that it is extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. She resided in the 1000 block of Reston Road in Tenmile, Oregon in 2000, and was a well-known community volunteer. Her family held a memorial service for her in October 2001, one year after she vanished. Chamblen's case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/hazel-lydia-chamblen,-123.4125723,43.1223383
Linda R. Chambrone,"August 1, 1980","Ocean Township, New Jersey",32,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",105 lbs,"Chambrone was last seen in Ocean Township, New Jersey on August 1, 1980. She lived with her husband in the 1200 block of Logan Road. They got into an argument and Chambrone left at 6:30 p.m.

After departing her residence, she stopped at a friend's home and watched television for awhile. She then left, telling her friend she planned to hitchhike to Asbury Park, New Jersey.

Chambrone has never been heard from again. She left her dog and all her personal belongings behind at home, including her clothes, purse and money.

Chambrone's husband reported his wife missing eighteen days later; he waited because it wasn't uncharacteristic of her to drop out of sight for a few days at a time without telling anyone. He and Chambrone were having severe marital problems in 1980, in part due to financial issues.

In 1985, William John Deeves Jr. confessed to killing Chambrone. He had murdered another woman, Sylvia Murphy, in 1984. A photo of Deeves is posted with this case summary. He had exhibited severe behavioral problems and symptoms of mental illness from early childhood and has an extensive criminal record dating back to his mid-teens, mostly for violent offenses.

Deeves stated he met Chambrone in an Asbury Park bar and drove her to Neptune, New Jersey. After she rejected his sexual advances he stopped the car, grabbed Chambrone by the feet and threw her from a bridge over a stream along Old Corlies Avenue in Neptune, New Jersey. Afterwards he went down to the embankment and pushed her body out into deeper water.

Police searched the stream with divers, but found nothing. The stream empties into the Shark River, which leads to the ocean. Deeves was convicted of Murphy's murder at trial, and in 1985 he pleaded guilty to Chambrone's murder. He was sentenced to a combined minimum term of fifty years in prison for both cases, and will not be eligible for parole until he is 82 years old.

Foul play is suspected in Chambrone's case due to the circumstances involved. Investigators don't believe her body can be recovered.",http://charleyproject.org/case/linda-r-chambrone,-74.2176448,39.7904391
Michaelle Marie Champagne,"March 9, 1993",Washington D.C.,30,Caucasian / White,"5'8""",120 lbs,"Champagne's parents last spoke to her on March 9, 1993. She had just returned to the United States from a trip home to Belgium with her live-in boyfriend, and was in Washington D.C. at the time of the conversation. She told her parents she was going to stay in town for a few days to see the sights before returning to her home in Spokane, Washington. This was the last verified contact with her.

Champagne had moved to the United States in 1990 with her American husband, whom she met while he was stationed with the military in Belgium. They lived in Germany for three years before moving to Spokane.

Champagne and her husband divorced in late 1992. He described her as an independent, strong-willed woman. She often supported herself working as a cook or a waitress. She had played soccer at a national level in Belgium, but gave up the sport after moving to the U.S. According to her ex-husband, Champagne had her father wire her a large sum of money from Belgium shortly before her disappearance. He thought this was odd, as she'd been granted $60,000 in their divorce settlement. She reportedly needed the money to pay off a debt, but he didn't know the details.

Champagne's boyfriend, Darryl Matlen, reported her missing on September 8, 1993. He told the police they'd broken up on March 17 and he was filing the report at the request of her parents. Matlen reported seeing her in June 1993, three months after anyone else last saw her. She was riding a motorcycle in the Spokane, Washington area at the time.

In the months between the time anyone heard from Champagne and the time he filed the missing persons report, Matlen used her credit cards, sold all the furniture she had in storage and sold their jointly owned car. When the police checked on his movements in March, they discovered he'd returned to Spokane on March 12 and checked into a hotel, apparently alone.

In 2011, police have renewed the investigation into Champagne's disappearance and collected DNA samples from her parents and brother in Belgium to compare with unidentified remains. They hope to locate and re-interview witnesses in her case. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Spokane police are investigating.",http://charleyproject.org/case/michaelle-marie-champagne,-77.0376861,38.906875

Chan vanished three times prior to her October 1999 disappearance; she returned to her residence of her own accord each time. She was suffering from depression and was due to deliver her second child in December 1999. She said that she slept under a tree in an area near Mission Boulevard and Paseo Padre Parkway in Fremont when she left her home in late September 1999. Chan returned to her house shortly thereafter, saying she needed time alone to think about her life.

Chan's husband reported her missing for the fourth time on October 9, 1999, but a search of the area uncovered no evidence as to Chan's whereabouts. Authorities checked the surrounding hospitals, but she had not been admitted as a patient. Chan's case remains unsolved.",http://charleyproject.org/case/michelle-ngan-ho-chan,-121.9886445,37.5469466

Chance applied for death benefits for her husband from the Veteran's Administration on March 28, 1948; he'd been in the Navy and had died in an accident in November 1947. Her application was approved in August of that year, but by then she had moved without leaving a forwarding address. She never collected any benefits and there's been no indication of her whereabouts since 1948.

Chandler's family members said that it is uncharacteristic of her to leave with unfamiliar people. She has a history of drug use and frequently socialized with motorcyclists in 1990. Her loved ones believe that foul play was involved in her case.

Her daughter became concerned as she was unable to reach her, and drove to Chandler's home to investigate. The house was deserted, Chandler's vehicle was parked in the driveway, and her dog was running loose in the yard. The doors to the house were all unlocked, the windows were open, and Chandler's belongings, including her purse and cigarettes, were left behind.

Dogs tracked Chandler's scent south along the highway for five miles from before they lost the trail. She may have been picked up by a passing motorist.

Foul play is possible in Chandler's case, as it is uncharacteristic of her to disappear completely and without warning. Some of her associates were involved with drugs, but it is unclear whether drugs were a factor in her case. She had been living in her house for twenty years prior to her disappearance. Her case remains unsolved. Chandler has a history of mental illness, with symptoms of schizophrenia.

Kristen Elizabeth Charbonneau,"August 11, 2005","Fort Worth, Texas",24,Caucasian / White,"5'2"" - 5'3""
",112 lbs,"Kristen Charbonneau was last seen leaving the Baby Dolls strip club on the far east side of Fort Worth, Texas at approximately 3:41 p.m. on August 11, 2005. She was employed at the club as a dancer.

Witnesses at the strip club stated she stumbled and fell down, as if she was under the influence, although it has not been established that she had actually drunk alcohol or taken drugs on the day of her disappearance. She had a history of drinking at work and getting too drunk to drive home; the management would call her a cab.

When Charbonneau left Baby Dolls on the afternoon she disappeared, a customer, Daniel Glen Moore, walked her to the door and carried her purse. By the time her taxi arrived to pick her up, she wasn't there. She has never been heard from again. Her dog and all her personal belongings were left behind.

Charbonneau attended Denton Ryan High School in Denton, Texas, but did not graduate; she dropped out of school and got her GED instead. She had been working at the strip club for five years prior to her disappearance. She has a criminal history for driving while intoxicated. Charbonneau resided with her boyfriend in Euless, Texas in 2005; that city's police are investigating her disappearance.

The week before her disappearance, she told her mother and said she and her boyfriend were going to marry and move to Wichita Falls, Texas. It was her boyfriend who reported her missing. Charbonneau paid for all her purchases with cash and did not have a bank account, credit cards or a cellular phone, making her difficult to track. Police initially believed she had left of her own accord and didn't thoroughly investigate the case, but they later concluded that foul play was involved.

Charbonneau's family long suspected Moore, a married car salesman and the father of two children, was involved in her disappearance. They posted fliers in his hometown of Arlington, Texas, as well as on the internet, accusing him of killing her. A photograph of Moore is posted with this case summary. He was a regular customer at Baby Dolls. In February 2010, he was arrested and charged with Charbonneau's murder.

Moore had been having an affair and, when his girlfriend saw the fliers that claimed he was involved in Charbonneau's disappearance, she confronted him about it. He allegedly told her he had accidentally killed Charbonneau. She told a friend, who went to the police in January 2010.

When authorities questioned Moore's girlfriend, she confirmed the account about his confession. Police searched a Kennedale, Texas house which belonged to a relative of Moore's, and they found a bullet hole in the headboard of a bed and a stain on the mattress that resembled blood. They were unable to obtain DNA from the stain for testing, however.

It wasn't until December 2010 that the police presented their case to a grand jury. The jury declined to indict Moore, however, so authorities had to drop the charges against him. They had been unable to confirm Moore's girlfriend's story, and her statements had been a major part of the evidence against him.

Authorities may attempt to bring the murder charge against Moore again in the future, if more evidence resurfaces.

Charbonneau is the oldest of five children in her family. One of her brothers died of cancer in childhood and another died in a motorcycle accident in 2008, three years after her disappearance, but her parents, sister and surviving brother are still alive and continue to search for her. Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/920

Josephine Carroll ChatrawÊ Ê*,"July 29, 1984","Syracuse, New York",36,White/Caucasian,"5' 3""",125 lbs,"Josephine was last seen on July 29, 1984 in Syracuse, New York. She spoke to one of her three sisters at approximately 1:00 a.m. that day from her home in the 200 block of Seymour Street that day. She has never been heard from again. Her sisters reported her as a missing person on August 3. She left behind five children.

Philip S. Whaley Sr., her boyfriend of several years, was the last person known to have seen Josephine. He lived in the 100 block of Seymour Street, a block from her apartment, and Josephine visited him at his home on the day of her disappearance.

Whaley told police he and Josephine got into an argument and she accused him of infidelity. He went into the bathroom to shave and when he came out, Josephine was gone. He said he saw her walking alone on Seymour Street afterwards.

Josephine and Whaley had a troubled relationship. Her loved ones frequently saw them fighting, but Josephine disliked it when others intervened and tried to protect him. Whaley was charged with unlawful imprisonment and assault several weeks before her disappearance; he had allegedly held her inside his apartment against her will. (The charges were dismissed in 1988, in exchange for Whaley's testimony against another person.)

Josephine told her sister Whaley had threatened to kill her and hide her body so no one could find it. One of Whaley's neighbors reported seeing Whaley beat Josephine at approximately 1:00 a.m. on the day of her disappearance, in the hallway outside her apartment. He punched her several times and dragged her inside by her hair. This is the last time anyone besides Whaley saw Josephine.

Whaley was eventually charged with Josephine's murder and the murder of another woman, Margaret Reiley, who disappeared in 1992. He went to trial in 1996. One of his friends testified that Whaley admitted to causing Josephine's death and burying her remains in a wooded area near Central Square. Several former girlfriends testified as to his violent behavior towards women.

Whaley maintained his innocence, but was convicted of both murders and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison. He was the first person in Onondaga County history to be convicted of murder without the victim's body, and his trial was also the first where DNA evidence was presented.

Whaley, who is still in prison and now in poor health, admitted responsibility for Reiley and Josephine's deaths in 2011. He said they were not intentional homicides, however. He offered to lead authorities to the bodies, and a search was launched in November.

Authorities looked for Josephine in a wooded area off Cusson Drive in Amboy, New York, but found nothing and gave up after two days. Whaley said he'd put Reiley's body in a garage next to his mother's home in Pulaski, New York, but the building has since been demolished and investigators believe her remains wound up in a landfill.

Foul play is suspected in Josephine's and Reiley's disappearances due to the circumstances involved. Their remains may not be recoverable.",http://charleyproject.org/case/josephine-carroll-chatraw,-76.1591188,43.0425081

Lucille Hellen Lewis,"January 30, 2006","St. Ignatius, MT",53,white,"5'2""",150 lbs,"Lewis moved from from Newberg, Oregon to St. Ignatius, Montana in November 2005. She relocated to be with her boyfriend, Earl Dean Stipe. Lewis had met him on the internet in October 2005, shortly after the dissolution of her twenty-year marriage, and was apparently unaware that he was a convicted felon.

None of Lewis's friends or family in Oregon heard from her after she moved to Montana, although she had been close to her family and was on friendly terms with her ex-husband. Her sister tried repeatedly to reach her by cellular phone, but to no result.

In February 2006, Lewis's sister contacted Stipe and asked about Lewis. Stipe stated Lewis had wanted to return to Oregon and he last saw her when he dropped her off at the Missoula International Airport in Missoula, Montana on January 31.

As Lewis had never arrived in Oregon, her sister became concerned and filed a missing persons report with Montana police. When investigators went to Stipe's home to question him about Lewis's disappearance found over a dozen firearms inside his residence.

Stipe, as a convicted felon on probation, is not legally allowed to own any guns, so he was arrested. In November 2007, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for being a felon in possession of firearms.

Subsequent investigation revealed that Stipe had forged Lewis's name on checks and had pawned some of her jewelry and other belongings. He had told Lewis he was a retired federal marshal who owned a ranch; in fact, he had never been a marshal and lived in a trailer with his adult son and his son's girlfriend and two children.

Although Stipe's felony conviction was for forgery and not for any violent offense, his son described him as was violent and abusive.

Although the circumstances surrounding Lewis's disappearance are unclear, Stipe is considered a person of interest in her case. Prior to moving to Montana she was employed as an underwriter at the Oregon Mutual Insurance company for over 25 years. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/23385

She was at a Walmart in Kennewick, Washington at the time. She called a friend in Billings, Montana and asked for an online money transfer so she would have enough money to get home to Crow Agency, Montana, 740 miles away; she had promised her children she'd take them trick-or-treating for Halloween.

Her friend agreed to send her the money, and Knows Gun said she was waiting at the Walmart customer service counter for it. Fifteen minutes later, her friend called her back to see if the money had arrived, but Knows Gun's phone wasn't working anymore and she never picked up the money. She has never been heard from again.

Knows Gun's family filed a missing persons report on November 14, after she missed her aunt's funeral; they had been close. Her loved ones stated she had been spending a lot of time in Billings, Montana before she went missing and had fallen in with a bad crowd. She was distancing herself from her family and began abusing drugs.

It's not uncharacteristic of Knows Gun to drop out of sight for a few days at a time, but she's never been gone for this long. Since her disappearance, her new friends have been uncooperative with the police about her case. The circumstances of her disappearance are unclear and her case remains unsolved. Crow Agency, Montana police are investigating Knows Gun's case.

Kimberly Irene Chavez Lopez,"June 22, 2015","Oxnard, California",3,Hispanic / Latina,"3'0""",50 lbs,"Kimberly was removed from her mother's custody after birth because she tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. She was returned to her mother, Mayra Chavez-Lopez, in February 2013 after Mayra took parenting classes and completed other programs to regain custody.

Later that year, she was removed from Mayra again after Ventura County Children and Family Services (CFS) workers found signs of abuse, including bruises and injuries all over her body in various stages of healing. A CFS worker later testified that Kimberly's mother, Mayra Chavez-Lopez, didn't have a strong bond with Kimberly and had wanted to leave her in the hospital after she was born because she already had a child and didn't think she could care for a new baby. According to witnesses, Mayra detested Kimberly and favored her older daughter.

Eventually Kimberly was placed in the care of her father, Omar Lopez. Mayra was allowed to visit her; the visits were supposed to be supervised by her mother and Omar. The situation wouldn't have been permitted by CFS if Mayra and Omar were living together, so the couple lied to social workers and claimed they had separated. Photos of Omar and Mayra are posted with this case summary.

The last time a CFS social worker saw Kimberly was on March 10, 2015. Kimberly was later at Omar's home on Denver Place in Oxnard, California in the summer of 2015.

More than a year later, someone called CFS and said they were concerned about Kimberly, and asked them to check on her. CFS workers attempted to do so several times, but Omar and Mayra told them she was staying with Omar's parents in Mexico. They didn't have any documentation or other evidence to support their story, however.

When authorities located Omar's mother, she said she had only ever met Kimberly four times, the last time in January 2015. Mayra then claimed that Kimberly was in Mexico with a family friend, but she had no contact information for this person. When police located him, he said didn't have her and had no idea where she was.

In September 2016, social workers filed a missing persons report. On October 7, 2016, both of Kimberly's parents were both jailed for civil contempt of court for their non-cooperation with the investigation. In August 2017, they were both charged with felony perjury.

Authorities initially stated that they were simply trying to verify Kimberly's well-being and thought she might still be in California, or she may be in Mexico, specifically Tijuana, Los Reyes, Michoacan or Guadalajara. However, in February 2018, her parents were charged with second-degree murder in her case. Mayra was initially charged with assault and torture; the torture charge referred to incidents that took place in 2013.

Police believe Kimberly died on June 22, 2015, just a few days after her third birthday. Omar made a statement to them in August 2017 and said that on June 21, the child fell on the floor and hit her head while her mother was changing her pants.

According to Omar, Kimberly didn't cry or complain after the injury, but she subsequently had two seizures, the first one about 30 to 45 minutes after she hit her head. The second seizure made her body feel ""like jelly."" Her parents didn't seek medical attention, and she died that same night; Omar tried to revive her with CPR but her body was in rigor mortis by then. This was in the early hours of June 22.

Her parents took her body to Tijuana, dug a shallow grave on a small hill with their bare hands, and buried her body there, wrapped in a blue plastic bag. After dumping it, Omar and Mayra out drinking at a couple of bars. Later, in July 2015, they exhumed Kimberly's body and attempted to dissolve her remains with bleach, pouring the smaller pieces down a shower drain. They then scattered the larger bones in three different places.

In April 2018, Omar pleaded guilty to felony perjury and a lesser charge of felony child endangerment. He agreed to testify against Mayra at her upcoming trial. In July, Mayra's mother, Maria De Jesus Lopez, was charged with conspiracy to destroy and conceal evidence in Kimberly's death. Authorities believe she lent Omar and Mayra her own vehicle and some money so they could make the trip to Tijuana, knowing that Kimberly was dead.

Omar testified against Mayra at her trial in December 2018. He stated Mayra began abusing heroin prior to Kimberly's death and regularly abused the child, ""punishing"" her with slaps, cold showers, and time-outs that lasted hours. Omar said he didn't try to stop Mayra from hurting Kimberly because he was afraid of CFS stepping in. Mayra's defense argued she and Omar were responsible for Kimberly's death, but pointing to her depression and drug addiction and suggested her actions were involuntary manslaughter rather than murder.

Mayra was convicted of second-degree murder, felony assault on a child causing death, and torture. She faces 32 to 47 years to life in prison. Omar will be sentenced to fourteen years in prison as per the terms of his plea agreement. He has also agreed to testify against Mayra's mother, who is still awaiting trial for her role in covering up Kimberly's murder.

Charlotte Estella Rexroad,"March 11, 1970","Canton, OH",34,White,"5'4""-5'6""",105-125 lbs,"Charlotte Rexroad was last seen in Canton, Ohio on March 11, 1970. She lived with her four children and her boyfriend of five years, Freeman ""Red"" Wyne Jr., in the McKinley Hotel. Wyne was the father of her two youngest children.

The couple left home that day to go to the laundromat, leaving the children behind in the care of a babysitter. After they left, however, they changed their plans. They stopped for drinks at either the Landmark Cafe or Dee Freconna's Factory Bar, then went to Benny Petsy's Hub Cafe in the 400 block of east Tuscarawas Avenue.

Wyne later gave conflicting accounts of Rexroad's disappearance to police. One story was that Rexroad began dancing with other men, and when he came out of the bathroom at 8:55 p.m., he saw her leaving with another man. Another account is that Rexroad left with a man and a woman, in spite of Wyne's attempts to get her to stay, and was last seen walking east on Tuscarawas Avenue.

Wyne returned to the hotel alone that night, drunk, and caused a disturbance. The police arrested him for public intoxication. He was released from jail the next morning after he paid a fine. That same morning, Rexroad's oldest daughter, who was fourteen years old at the time, reported her missing. She said it was uncharacteristic of Rexroad to leave without warning and she feared Wyne had harmed her. Wyne said he believed Rexroad had simply left him. He was interviewed twice by police, the last time four days after Rexroad's disappearance was reported. He never contacted the police about her case again.

The four Rexroad children were placed in foster care after their mother's disappearance. The oldest child went to live with an uncle in West Virginia and the younger three were eventually adopted by another family.

In 1996, two of Rexroad's daughters located Wyne in West Virginia, and he invited them to visit his home. He had had a stroke and was confined to a wheelchair. When they questioned him about Rexroad's disappearance, he said he didn't remember much about the night she went missing. Wyne died in 2008 at age 76.

Rexroad's children are still looking for her and still believe Wyne probably killed her. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/19498

Amanda Duncan,"July 2, 1993","Ipswich, Suffolk",26,Caucasian / White,"5'7""",,"mother-of-two Amanda Duncan went missing while working in the red light district of Ipswich. The 26 year old was last seen by several people between 11.30pm and midnight on July 2, at which point she was in the Portman Road area of the town. Amanda, who lived in Woodbridge, was reported missing the following morning by her sister, who had gone to visit Amanda at her Balliol Close home.

On the day of her disappearance, Amanda had left her three-year-old son Jamie in the care of her parents and her nine-month-old baby Damien with her boyfriend before leaving for Ipswich.

She visited a house in London Road at around 11.10pm with the intention of buying drugs. She agreed to go back to the house later that evening to finalise the deal but never returned.

She was then dropped off in the Portman Road area at 11.30pm and at around midnight she was seen talking to the driver of a dark-coloured Ford Sierra, possibly of green or blue colour, in PortmanÕs Walk. This vehicle and its driver have never been traced by police. No one has heard from Amanda since she went missing and although police are concerned that she may have come to harm, no evidence of any abduction or attack has ever been found.

She is described as being 5ft 7, of medium build and having shoulder-length fair hair at the time she went missing. She also has a heart-shaped tattoo on her upper left arm and was wearing a black leather bomber jacket, a pink knee-length dress and a gold cross and chain. Speaking on the 25th anniversary of AmandaÕs disappearance, Andy Guy, of the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: ÒOver the years there has been much speculation and we have heard many rumours about what might have happened to Amanda.

ÒAt this significant anniversary since she was last seen, I would ask those who have information to do the right thing and help us to resolve the suspicious disappearance of a mother who left behind two very young children and a heartbroken family.Ó","https://www.suffolknews.co.uk/ipswich/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-mysteries-behind-suffolks-missing-people-9119755/

She was on the way to a neighborhood bar, The Thrift City, and said she planned to call a friend from the establishment's pay phone once she got there. She has never been heard from again

Nickell's loved ones were not initially alarmed when she did not return home; they assumed she was at her friend's house. When three days passed without contact, however, her sister contacted police.

According to her sister, Nickell dropped out of high school in the eleventh grade and used drugs recreationally in 1976. Her sister described Nickell as a ""flower child"" and ""too trusting."" Both of their parents were alcoholics and the girls grew up in very poor circumstances, in a home without running water.

Nickell left home as a teenager and stayed with several relatives after that, the last ones being her sister and brother-in-law.

Her father, who was allegedly physically abusive towards his family, is considered a possible suspect in her disappearance. Authorities searched his property with cadaver dogs in 2003, but found no evidence. Nickell's father died in the 1990s and was never charged in his daughter's case; it has not been established that he was involved.

Nickell is a former employee of the Red Ribbon Bar and Town and Country Lanes, both situated in Flint. She has been known to hitchhike between Flint, Whittemore, and Tawas, Michigan.

Kimora Monique Simon,"May 1, 2015","Flint, MI",3,Black,"3'6""",21 lbs,"Kimora was last seen in Flint, Michigan sometime in May of 2015. Her disappearance went unnoticed for a year and a half, during with time her parents collected $7,300 in public assistance checks for her.

The fact that Kimora was missing finally came to the attention of authorities in November 2016, after a teacher saw suspicious marks on her five-year-old brother and filed a child abuse report with Michigan's Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

A DHHS employee went to Kimora's family's home in the Evergreen Regency apartment complex in Flint to investigate, realized Kimora wasn't there and asked where she was. Kimora's mother, Erika Shantae Finley, said she was with her father, Khairy Joshuawon Simon, who lived in Detroit, Michigan.

This wasn't true, however. Subsequent investigation revealed that Kimora's relatives hadn't seen her at all in over a year, her parents had given conflicting explanations for her disappearance, and Khairy's girlfriend of eight months had never met her.

Kimora's older siblings were removed from home and placed in protective custody in a foster home. In December, Erika and Khairy were both charged with felony murder, child abuse, evidence tampering and lying to police.

In the summer of 2018, Khairy and Erika both made plea agreements with the prosecution: Erika pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and was sentenced to a 15 to 40 years in prison, and Khairy pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 12 to 40 years.

In court, they admitted they beat Kimora to death after a toilet training accident, wrapped her body in a white plastic trash bag and took it away from the apartment in a backpack. Khairy said he buried her body by a set of railroad tracks near their apartment complex. An extensive search turned up no clues, however, and police think it's possible Kimora's body was removed from its grave by animals.

Erika read a letter she read to the judge before receiving her sentence, stating, ""I cannot tell you express how sorry I am to everyone for what has happened during this situation,"" but did not actually admit guilt. Khairy also apologized to ""everybody that this situation has affected"" and asked for forgiveness.

Both of Kimora's brothers were placed in foster care, and their foster family intends to adopt them. Foul play is suspected in Kimora's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/kimora-monique-simon,-83.6490698,43.0013664

Brianna Jayde Vibert,July 17 2017,"Flint Township, MI",24,White,"5'9""",120 lbs,"Vibert at a Marathon Gas Station on Miller Road in Flint Township, Michigan on July 17, 2017. She often went there to charge her phone or use the bathroom. Surveillance video from the gas station shows Vibert appearing anxious, even panicked, and she had blood on the inside of her right forearm.

According to Vibert's boyfriend, just before she went to the Marathon station the night before her disappearance, they'd gotten into an argument. He said the argument began because Vibert's four children weren't able to visit her house because there was no running water there. Vibert's boyfriend stated she was screaming, throwing things and cut her arm with a knife before she left the house that night.

At 1:00 a.m., at the Marathon station, she got into a red Pontiac Aztek driven by an African-American male. After her disappearance, the man contacted police and cooperated with the investigation; he has not been named as a suspect in her case.

He said she asked him for a ride to a restaurant, and she visited a local adult entertainment club where she had previously worked. Employees at the club said Vibert was in ""pretty bad shape"" when she arrived and she left with the same man who'd given her a ride at the gas station earlier.

She was sighted at a Mobil gas station at 2:45 a.m. Surveillance footage there showed her stumbling inside the building, holding onto shelves to stay upright. Afterwards she was filmed walking in the parking lot; the man she'd gotten rides from was traveling in the opposite direction.

She left her phone behind in the red Aztek and has never been heard from again. Days later, police found her bag in a ditch near her home. The man in the red Aztek had her phone for six days before he charged it and turned it on, which lead to his discovery by police.

Vibert left behind four children. She had gotten divorced shortly before her disappearance and had a rocky relationship with both her ex-husband and her new boyfriend. According to her mother, Vibert's new boyfriend physically abused her, and when her friends offered to help, he threatened them.

Although Vibert's mother stated she did maintain regular contact with her family, she also stated there were times with Vibert would refuse to answer her phone for weeks after her mother would offer to help her.

A few days after Childress was reported missing, police found her car being driven by a man in Henderson. He was arrested on an unrelated charge, and stated Childress had sold him the vehicle, something her family finds difficult to believe.

Starting in mid-September 2015, about a month before Childress went missing, her sister, Patricia Nichols, began receiving strange Facebook messages from her. The first message said there was an emergency and Childress needed her phone number. Three weeks later Nichols got another message that just said ""Sister where are I, what's going on.""

On October 6, Nichols got a voice message from Childress's Facebook account. The message said something about guardian angels, but the voice wasn't Childress's. Nichols left home after that and didn't return until November 6, by which time Childress was missing.

Two women contacted Nichols after Childress's disappearance and said they knew what had happened to her. The women stated Childress had been involved in using and selling drugs, and gotten some bad people angry, and was tortured and killed as a result. This information has not been verified.

Childress was seeing Felipe Villanueva at the time of his disappearance.

Hannah Emily Upp,"September 14, 2017","St. Thomas, VI",32,White,"5'7""",120-130 lbs,"Upp was last seen in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 14, 2017. She disappeared a week after Hurricane Irma struck the island, and a week before Hurricane Maria arrived and caused heavy rain.

Upp has disappeared before. In August 2008, while she was living in New York City and had a job teaching school, she went missing on the first day of school and wasn't found for twenty days. People on the Staten Island Ferry found her floating facedown in the water, about a mile off the southern tip of Manhattan. She was rescued, hospitalized and treated for hypothermia, severe sunburn and dehydration, then transferred to a psychiatric unit.

After her rescue, Upp was able to recall her identity but couldn't explain why she'd gone missing and had only vague recollections of the time she was gone. It was later determined she spent the time roaming around New York City. After a series of tests, doctors couldn't find anything physically wrong with her and diagnosed her with dissociative fugue. This condition is usually caused by psychological trauma, but Upp stated she had not had any severe traumas in her life.

Four years later, in 2012, Upp moved to Maryland and took a job at a Montessori school there. She disappeared again, also on the first day, and found herself two days later in a creek about a mile and a half from her school; she'd apparently gone into a dissociative fugue again. She resumed her normal life and went back to work afterwards.

A year after that, she moved to St. Thomas and took a job at the Virgin Islands Montessori School. She disappeared for the final time four years later. She left her undress, sandals and car keys at a small bar on Sapphire Beach, where she often snorkeled.

Upp is a skilled, physically fit swimmer and might conceivably have survived for days in the water. Her loved ones hope she's still alive; one theory is she got on one of the many boats evacuating the island due to the hurricanes, and traveled to Florida, the Bahamas, St. Croix or Puerto Rico. Her case remains unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/hannah-emily-upp,-64.850925,18.3353754
Helen Lundgren Dalton,"April 3, 1963","Greensboro, NC",52,White,"5'7""",150 lbs,"Helen was last seen in Greensboro, North Carolina on April 3, 1963. She dropped her daughter off at high school that morning and reminded her that she had a dental appointment in a few hours. Helen was going to pick her daughter up for the appointment at noon, but she never did; instead, her son picked his sister up.

When the couple's son picked his sister up at school that day, he said his father had told him Helen had gone to a Women's Christian Association conference in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and this was why she was unavailable to get her daughter from school. The children never saw their mother again.

At the time of her disappearance, Helen lived in the 100 block of Muir's Chapel Road with her husband of nineteen years, Donald, and their two teenage children. Donald operated a heating and air conditioning repair business behind their home, and Helen ran her own business, Bonnie's Beauty Shop.

Helen's sister in Dearborn, Michigan received two letters, supposedly from Helen, in April and May 1963, but didn't believe the letters were actually written by her. They were typewritten, and Helen normally hand-wrote her letters; the letters also used phrasing she didn't normally use.

Helen's sister tried to call her at home several times, but each time Donald would say she was not at home. At one point he claimed she had gone off to live by herself and was staying in a motel in Roanoke, Virginia. Helen's sister tried to contact the motel to verify this story, but learned no such place existed.

Helen's sister then went to North Carolina to investigate, and couldn't find Helen. Donald wouldn't let her into the house and wasn't helpful as to her whereabouts. He said she had simply left him, taking a large sum of money with her, and seemed unconcerned about it, but Helen's sister suspected foul play. On August 22, over four months after she disappeared, her sister reported her missing.

When interviewed, Donald said Helen had left him and taken about $20,000 in cash with her, and that he thought she left to have a lesbian relationship with a woman named Wanda Flemming. He said he hadn't seen Helen since she left, but that she did call him sometime in July. When asked why he hadn't reported Helen missing, Donald said he didn't know. He was seeing another woman by this time, and he said he didn't care about the missing money but hoped Helen returned, for the sake of their children.

Police checked on Donald's initial story, that Helen had gone to a Christian women's conference and that's why she didn't pick her daughter up from school, but there was no such conference in Winston-Salem at the time. When police checked on the Wanda Flemming story, they found only one person with that name in the entire state of North Carolina. She said she'd never heard of Helen Dalton, and no one else in Helen's family had heard of her.

The police were suspicious of Donald and his constantly changing stories and asked him to take a lie detector test, but he refused. Investigators searched the Daltons' home and noted Helen's closet was full of clothes, and they found her luggage, her only denture set and only pair of eyeglasses. There was a typewriter in the house, and analysis of the letters sent to Helen's sister showed they were composed on that machine.

There was no evidence of foul play, however, and although authorities thought Donald knew Helen's whereabouts and was lying about the circumstances of her disappearance, they couldn't find any proof of this. The case was reactivated in 1993 and authorities excavated an old well on the Daltons' former property, but couldn't find anything of interest, and the search had to be stopped prematurely because of safety issues.

Donald, who had remarried and divorced twice in the intervening years, was interviewed by the press at the time of the dig and said Helen had left him in 1963. He said she was tired of raising their children and that the beauty shop she ran was a drop point for money from drug sales and sports racketeering. Helen's loved ones disagreed with Donald's description of her and said she was a devoted mother.

Helen's disappearance is the oldest unsolved case in North Carolina history.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/60043

Otto got a ride home later with a friend, 27-year-old James Earl Gibson. He later told police that he took two other people home and then dropped Otto off at her apartment at Maison de Ville Apartments in the 800 block of Royce Street. She never arrived home and has never been heard from again.

Otto had a history of dropping out of sight for days at a time, but she'd never been gone for longer than three days without calling home, and her family became worried after she failed to contact them over Thanksgiving. She was not reported missing until December 8. She was unemployed at the time of her disappearance, but looking for a job, and had gotten an interview for a position at the mall.

A photo of Gibson is posted with this case summary. He was later sentenced to 35 years in prison for a 1994 kidnapping and rape. He had abducted an eighteen-year-old girl, an acquaintance of Otto's, sexually assaulted her and held her for nearly nine hours before releasing her. Authorities believe he could be a serial killer.

Sharon Ann Martin,"March 31, 2006","Pensacola, Florida",55 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 6"" (66 Inches)",140 lbs,"Martin was last seen in Pensacola, Florida on March 31, 2006. She was showing a man and woman an apartment she managed on on East Nine Mile Road that day. She called her husband at lunchtime. She has never been heard from again.

About a month after Martin disappeared, John Homer Docherty IV was arrested and charged with grand theft, forgery, fraud, and illegal use of a credit card. He'd used Martin's credit card at a local Wal-Mart several times after her disappearance, and he tried to cash a forged check in her name as well. He was a maintenance worker at an apartment complex Martin owned, and they had a close relationship; Martin's husband suspected they were lovers.

Authorities searched Docherty's apartment and found a piece of bloodstained carpet in the bedroom that matched Martin's DNA, as well as other possible blood traces. In November 2006, he was additionally charged with Martin's murder.

A witness stated on the night of Martin's disappearance, he helped Docherty lift a heavy trash can into a dumpster. He said it ""didn't feel right"" and he even asked Docherty if the trash can contained a body. Docherty gave him $450 in cash after they'd put the can in the dumpster.

Another witness saw Docherty looking through the dumpster with a flashlight that same night. Police believe he may have removed Martin's body at that time and disposed of it elsewhere.

At his trial in 2008, Docherty's defense argued there was no proof Martin was dead and she might have left on her own. She had dropped out of sight for as long as eight months at a time before.

A jury convicted Docherty of manslaughter in February 2008, acquitting him of the more serious charge of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. He maintains his innocence in Martin's presumed homicide. Docherty has a prior criminal record for theft-, fraud- and weapons-related charges. He is scheduled for release in 2021.

Martin is an Air Force veteran and former flight attendant. Investigators believe Docherty killed her to obtain her $2.5 million fortune. Her body has never been found, but foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/29932?nav

She was last seen in Pensacola, Florida.

Jadekiss's mother had died, and she and her older sister were living with their grandmother. Her sister stated the night she went missing, Jadekiss walked outside the house to sit on the front porch, and never came back inside.

Another family member reported seeing her later that night. She was standing by the side of the road on north L Street near Maxwell Street, about a quarter of a mile with her house, with an unidentified man. She has never been heard from again.

Ten days later, a bag mysteriously appeared on the family's front porch; it contained several cellular phones, as well some of Jadekiss's clothes.

For unclear reasons, the bag was not entered into evidence with the police until 2018. Investigators stated when they asked Jadekiss's grandmother about the bag, she said they were just some of Jadekiss's old clothes. However, Jadekiss's grandmother says the clothes were actually the exact ones her granddaughter was last seen wearing.

Although many agencies classify Jadekiss as a runaway and investigators stated she may be in Las Vegas, Nevada or in Louisiana, the circumstances of her disappearance are unclear.

She was accompanied by a male friend at the time. Brenda told her mother she was going to visit friends who lived in Abernant, Alabama, approximately ten miles northeast of her family's home.

Brenda was last seen at a residence across the street from Hosmer's Grocery on Highway 216 in Abernant later during the day. Her friend dropped her off at the house to visit other friends, but her friends weren't home and Brenda's driver left her standing on the doorstep, waiting for them to return. At 9:30 p.m., Brenda called home and told her mother she wouldn't be home until later. She has never been heard from again.

Brenda had run away from home before, but she was never gone for very long. Police initially thought she had run away again when she disappeared in July 1988, but now they believe she disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Her case remains unsolved.","http://charleyproject.org/case/brenda-kay-green

Andrea D'Anne Durham,"February 1, 1990","Fort Walton Beach, Florida",13 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 3"" (63 Inches)",110 lbs,"Andrea was last seen at her family's residence at Royale Apartments at the corner of Colonial Drive and Mayflower Avenue in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, which she shared with her mother and older sister. Her mother and sister left, asking her to vacuum while they were gone.

When Andrea's family returned to their residence two hours later, they found it unlocked with no indication of forced entry. Andrea's purse, clothes, makeup and all other personal belongings were undisturbed inside. The vacuum cleaner standing upright in the living room.

Agencies classify Andrea's case as that of a runaway or a possible non-family abduction. The circumstances surrounding her disappearance remain unclear; there is very little evidence as to her fate. Authorities originally thought she was a runaway, but now they believe other forces may have been at work in her disappearance.

Andrea had had to change schools and move to a new apartment and she was unhappy about this, which was part of the reason investigators believed she had run away. She also gotten into trouble with the law; she acted as a lookout for other children while they stole money out of vehicles in a restaurant parking lot. She was sentenced to community service for her role in the offense, and her sister stated she wasn't worried about it. All the charges against her have now been voided.

Andrea attended Prior Middle School in 1990, and was a good student. Her hobbies at the time of her disappearance included camping, tennis, dancing and going to the beach, and she was very spiritual from a young age. She hasn't had any contact with her family or friends since she went missing. Her family never believed she had run away.

Police have investigated the possibility that Andrea's disappearance was connected to Mark Riebe and William Alex Wells III, who are suspected of having kidnapped and murdered a woman in Santa Rosa, Florida, in 1989. So far they have not found any link between Andrea and the suspects, but the possibility has not been ruled out.

Investigators believe Andrea remained in the area for a short time after she disappeared, but if she was on the streets she probably did not survive long. Many rumors have circulated about her disappearance, but none have been substantiated.

Andrea's mother now lives in South Carolina. She remains missing and her case is unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/4711?nav

Kristy Jean Rogers,"August 2, 1997","Crestview, Florida",16 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 3"" (63 Inches)",109 lbs,"Kristy told her family she was spending the night of August 1, 1997 at a girlfriend's home in Crestview, Florida. She stayed at her boyfriend's instead. This was the first time she had spent the night with him.

Her boyfriend, Mack Cawthon, told authorities Kristy departed his house on north Lloyd Street at approximately 5:00 a.m. on August 2. He asked her to leave early so his grandparents, who lived next door, would not know she had stayed there. Cawthon's residence was located less than one mile from Kristy's family's Walnut Avenue house, about a fifteen-minute walk. She never arrived home and has never been heard from again.

In February 1998, six months after Kristy's disappearance, a bag containing clothing belonging to her was found in a wooded area behind the Crestview Plaza Shopping Center. The area had already been thoroughly searched by investigators and cadaver dogs; they believe, therefore, that the bag was left there after the search.

The contents included a shirt, shorties, underpants, a bra, socks, keys, and makeup, all belonging to Kristy. The bag was not hidden and the clothes inside appeared to be more weathered than the bag.

Unidentified female remains were located in a canal west of Boynton Beach, Florida in 1999, two years after Kristy vanished. Authorities incorrectly identified the body as Kristy in January 2001. Her loved ones finalized funeral arrangements by the time the mistake was corrected, but the burial had not taken place. Investigators initially believed that Kristy's dental records matched the victim. The error was reported less than one week after the incorrect identification was announced.

Police originally believed Kristy was a runaway, but later decided she met with foul play due to the long period of time that passed where she didn't contact anyone. At first they investigated her family, who have all since been ruled out as suspects. Cawthon has not been named as a suspect either, and investigators stated there were no inconsistencies in his story. They described his relationship with Kristy as ""on-again, off-again."" She was not having any problems at the time of her disappearance and she left behind all her belongings, including her kidney medication.

Authorities believe Kristy was abducted by someone she knew. Her mother describes her as a naive, trusting individual. Kristy's mother now lives in Alabama, but continues to hope for resolution in her daughter's disappearance. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/6595?nav

Jackie Lee McWaters,"July 21, 2006","Crestview, Florida",34 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 5"" (65 Inches)",110 - 115 lbs,"McWaters's family last saw her at a Super Bowl party in Freeport, Florida on October 21, 2005. She left for a party in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, promising her niece she would return to babysit her niece's children, but she never came back. Her niece repeatedly tried to call her and no one answered.

Someone, possibly McWaters, did leave a message on a relative's answering machine saying her car had broken down and she couldn't come back. This is the last time any of her relatives heard from her; her phone number was disconnected a year later.

Law enforcement officers in Crestview, Florida reportedly made contact with McWaters sometime in July 2006. They saw her walking in the vicinity of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Booker Street, checked her identity and then let her go. This is the last sign of her; since her disappearance she hasn't been arrested and hasn't used her credit cards or Social Security number.

McWaters became depressed after a divorce and the death of one of her sons, and got involved with alcohol and drugs. She was arrested multiple times in 2004 and 2005. While she was in jail she wrote many times to her family and friends, saying she felt neglected and abandoned.

Her father initially thought she might be in jail and didn't want the family to know. He didn't report her missing until 2009.

McWaters's father is now deceased and her mother is in poor health. The circumstances of her disappearance are unclear, but her family still hopes she may be found.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/37251?nav

Calandra Rachel Stallworth,"March 27, 2017","Crestview, Florida",28 Years,Black / African American,"5' 5"" - 5' 7"" (65 - 67 Inches)",200 - 220 lbs,"Stallworth was last seen in Crestview, Florida on March 29, 2017. She was last seen by her family on March 27, when she dropped her two daughters off at their grandmother's home next door to her own, so she could go to her housekeeping job at Hilton Sandestin Beach Resort. She called home that evening to say she was on her way home, but she never arrived. Her family reported her missing that same day.

On March 29, Stallworth went to the police department in Crestview and asked them to cancel the missing persons report, saying she had been in Alabama with her boyfriend and hadn't been able to get in touch with her family because her phone last signal. Although Stallworth was close to her family and usually spoke to her grandmother on a daily basis, she did not contact them after leaving the police station. She has never been heard from again.

On April 2, the police pulled over Stallworth's car after it left a Motel 6 on Harbor Boulevard in Destin, Florida. Her boyfriend of three years, Antwon Montrex Smith, was driving it and another woman, 18-year-old Taleah Durm, was with him. Stallworth's purse and cellular phone were in the car. Durm had been reported missing a few days earlier, on March 29. When police found her in Stallworth's vehicle, they canceled the missing person report.

Smith was arrested for cocaine and marijuana possession, driving without a license and probation violation. He told police he had dropped Stallworth off at another man's residence, and didn't reveal any other information about her disappearance.

A photo of him is posted with this case summary. He was sentenced to prison on the drug possession charge and other charges. It's unclear what Durm's connection is to him and Stallworth. Stallworth's family believes Smith may have been involved in her disappearance. They described him as controlling, and think he may have been abusive.

In October 2010, Smith was charged with capital murder in the shooting deaths of two men, Ryan Frazier and Joshua Carroll, both from the Seattle, Washington area. They were linemen for a contracting company and had been installing cable lines in Elberta, Alabama when they were killed. According to police, Smith was a ""drug associate"" of the victims, and they think the murders happened due to a drug deal gone bad. When he was arrested, he was driving Frazier's vehicle. He is awaiting trial in the murders.

It's uncharacteristic of Stallworth to leave without warning, and her family believes she came to harm, but police stated her case was being investigated as a missing person rather than a crime. Her disappearance remains unsolved.","https://charleyproject.org/case/calandra-rachel-stallworth

Tangena Hussain,"October 2, 2008","Detroit, MI",2,Asian (Bangladeshi),"3'2""",34 lbs,"Tangena was last seen at a Marathon gas station in the 20500 block of Greenfield Road in Detroit, Michigan on October 2, 2008. Her mother's live-in boyfriend, Jamrul Hussain, stopped there to get gas and buy some gum and juice.

He left Tangena in his red four-door 1997 Geo Prism and went into the store at 9:02 p.m. He came out at 9:06 p.m and Tangena was gone. He says his car was locked at the time of her disappearance.

Jamrul didn't call the police or search for that child at that time. Instead, he drove to pick up Tangena's mother, Nilufa Begum, from her job at a clothing store in the nearby Northland Mall. Begum asked him where her daughter was, and Jamrul replied he would take her to where Tangena was.

The couple returned to the gas station and asked employees there if there were surveillance cameras in the area where Jamrul's car had been parked. There were no cameras on that side of the building, although surveillance cameras do show Jamrul making his purchases in the store. Jamrul and Begum filed a missing child report with police at 9:30 p.m.

Although they share the same surname, Tangena and Jamrul aren't related. Jamrul and Begum are immigrants from Bangladesh. They'd been dating about five months by the time Tangena disappeared.

Jamrul's attorney maintains his client knows little about American culture and the American legal system, although he does speak reasonably good English. Police admitted that language and cultural barriers have impeded their investigation.

Tangena's father, Mohammed Ahmed, lives in New York. Ahmed and Begum were married for five years before their divorce in 2006. Their other two children live with Ahmed's parents in Bangladesh.

After Tangena's disappearance was publicized, a fifteen-year-old girl went to police and said she recognized Jamrul from a television broadcast and that he had kidnapped her at gunpoint, held her captive for a week, and raped her repeatedly in February 2008. She said she hadn't reported the crime before because Jamrul had threatened to kill her and her family; instead, she claimed she had run away with her boyfriend.

Investigators arrested Jamrul for kidnapping and rape, and also charged the couple who lived in the house where the girl said she'd been imprisoned. The charges against them were later dismissed, and the charges against Jamal were reduced to criminal sexual conduct after two witnesses testified that he and the girl had been dating each other.

In December 2009, Jamrul was convicted of statutory rape. He was sentenced to one and a half to fifteen years in prison.

Begum initially supported Jamrul, saying he loved Tangena and cared for her like a daughter. By November 2008, however, she publicly stated she doubted Jamrul's version of events and believed he knew more about Tangena's disappearance than he was telling.

Begum took a polygraph of her own initiative and passed the test. Jamrul took a polygraph as well, but he was so upset at the time that the results were useless. He refused to take the test again. Begum has since returned to Bangladesh. She says she believes Tangena is still alive.

Although some investigators stated they have serious doubts about Jamrul's story, he hasn't been named a suspect in Tangena's disappearance. Her case is investigated as a missing child rather than as a crime. Little evidence is available as to her fate.",https://charleyproject.org/case/tangena-hussain,-83.2001418,42.4441618

After work, she came home, did laundry and talked to her mother-in-law and husband on the phone. The conversation with her husband, Douglas Earl Davis, was the last contact.

Douglas reported her missing the next day. He stated she left a note saying she was going to her job at a McDonald's restaurant, but her coworkers said she wasn't scheduled to work. She often filled in for others who were sick, but no one had asked her to work for them that day.

Vickie reportedly took a suitcase, makeup and some clothes with her when she vanished. She has never been heard from again

Her car, a 1971 Nova, was found locked and abandoned in a parking lot behind a steakhouse next to the McDonald's. The keys were missing. There were no fingerprints at the scene besides those of Vickie and Douglas.

On a related note, in 1984, three years before Vickie disappeared, her husband was charged with murdering a coworker and her four-year-old son. Police believe he beat the woman and child to death with a board at Sunbelt Forest Products, a lumberyard in Bartow, Florida.

Douglas, who was eighteen years old at the time, was charged with the murders two days later. He failed six polygraph examinations about the case and he confessed, but a judge decided his statement was ""psychologically coerced"" and ruled it inadmissible.

Douglas was acquitted at his trial in 1986; the jurors deliberated only ninety minutes and all of them were unconvinced of his guilt from the beginning. Vickie went missing nine months later.

Investigators viewed Douglas as a suspect in his wife's disappearance from the onset of the investigation and they stated Vickie's disappearance looked staged.

Vickie had never been known to park her car at the location where it was found, and the driver's seat was adjusted to fit someone taller than her. Her family also said she never wore makeup due to her religious beliefs and would never have taken any with her if she had left.

Douglas spoke to law enforcement about Vickie's case only twice, once when he reported her missing and once in 1993. He has since remarried and lives in Arkansas, and maintains his innocence in Vickie's disappearance. He says he heard she had hitchhiked to the West Coast, possibly California.

Vickie left behind a young daughter. Her family believes she is dead, as they don't think she would have abandoned her child. Foul play is suspected in her case.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/28227/details?nav

Pamela June Ray,"August 12, 1992","Panama City, Florida",36 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 3"" (63 Inches)",110 lbs,"Ray drove from her residence in Atlanta, Georgia to Panama City, Florida during the early morning hours of August 12, 1992. She was accompanied by her children, ages five and twelve, at the time. They planned to take a short beach vacation before the school year started.

Ray was not able to locate a vacant motel room in Panama City upon their arrival at approximately 3:30 a.m. She parked her blue 1991 Plymouth Sundance in the parking lot of the former Wilhite Apartments complex on Front Beach Road for the remainder of the night. Ray was spotted by seven witnesses at the complex, including two police officers.

She locked her car and left her children asleep in the backseat at approximately 5:30 a.m. She also left her purse, traveler's checks and keys behind in the vehicle. She walked from the apartment lobby to the swimming pool area at that time and was apparently followed by an unidentified Caucasian man. The same man had been seen earlier in the morning, urinating in public. Witnesses heard a woman screaming for help from the vicinity of the pool at the same time Ray walked towards the area. She has never been seen again.

One of the police officers who saw her on the night she vanished underwent hypnosis shortly afterwards. He described the unidentified man who followed Ray as having light hair and light eyes. The suspect stood approximately 6'0 and weighed 150 pounds. He wore a shirt with alternating dark and light-colored horizontal stripes.

A man resembling the officer's description was arrested for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a woman from Chipley, Florida in March 1992 shortly after the hypnosis session. The attack took place five months prior to Ray's disappearance.

Charges against the suspect were eventually dropped due to conflicting descriptions given by the victim. He has never been connected to Ray's disappearance, but authorities searched the area where the woman had been attacked for evidence regarding Ray's case. Nothing was uncovered.

On a side note, a bank clerk in Georgia mistakenly wired approximately $400,000 into Ray's father's account in 1989. Ray was allegedly one of the family members who helped her father spend the money.

Ray's father pleaded guilty to theft of mislaid property in 1991. He repaid the majority of the cash, but prosecutors were frustrated with the lack of payment progress. Other family members, including Ray and her husband, were indicted in 1992 and released on bond.

The family reportedly purchased a condominium at the Gulf Highlands Beach Resort in Panama City under Ray's name. Investigators do not believe that the financial problems were connected to Ray's disappearance.

The suspected serial killer Mark Riebe confessed to Ray's murder. He murdered a woman in 1989 and was convicted in her killing in 1998, and has also confessed to the murders of almost a dozen other women who disappeared or were murdered. A photo of Riebe is posted with this case summary. He later recanted his statement about being involved in Ray's death, but her family believes he was her killer. In Riebe's statement, he said Ray was carrying a single key, something she was known to do.

According to Riebe's daughter, who was four years old at the time of Ray's disappearance, her family suddenly moved from northwest Florida to Warrensburg, Illinois, shortly after Ray went missing. They took two U-Haul trucks with them, and upon their arrival, Riebe forced his children to dig holes in the ground and he buried some bags in the holes. In 2019, the police in Illinois dug up the property where Riebe's family had lived. They haven't found any remains, however.

Ray's case remains open and unsolved. Foul play is suspected.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/18125?nav

At his trial in October 2012, his attorney argued Hughes asked Davis to sell the car for him because he was in debt to drug dealers and needed money to ""disappear"" and move to Barbados. Davis was acquitted. He has a prior criminal record for battery, burglary, grand theft and marijuana possession. A photo of him is posted with this case summary.

On May 20, thirteen days after Rhodes and Hughes were last seen, Davis was seen driving Hughes's pearl-white 2003 Cadillac Escalade with the Florida license plate number 912NWJ. The vehicle itself wasn't found until October 5; it had been covered with a tarp and parked in the back of a property in DeFuniak Springs, Florida.

In late July 2012, Davis charged with grand theft and burglary. Neighbors had seen him loading Hughes's belongings into a U-Haul truck the month he and Rhodes disappeared. Davis admitted he had done this, but said he'd only been helping Hughes move to another location.

Authorities found furniture and other property belonging to Hughes in Davis's possession. He had also pawned some items and sold others online.

He gave some of Hughes's belongings to the people who helped him load Davis's things into the U-Haul, as payment for their work. One of the items he gave away was a lamp; later, authorities recovered it and discovered Hughes's blood on it.

Davis also made numerous withdrawals from Hughes's bank accounts, writing checks totaling $15,900. Hughes had gotten a substantial financial settlement after a workplace injury, and had assets of over $400,000.

In February 2013, Davis was charged with the couple's murders. Tiffani Steward, his former girlfriend, testified against him; she stated she saw Davis beat and strangle Rhodes and Hughes and drown them in the bathtub, and she also saw him burning a tote bag which he claimed contained the victims' dismembered remains. He was convicted and sentenced to death.

Davis is now on Florida's death row, awaiting execution. Foul play is suspected in Rhodes and Hughes's disappearances due to the circumstances involved.","https://charleyproject.org/case/heidi-ann-rhodes

She was in the process of breaking up with her live-in boyfriend, William Daily, and that day they got into an altercation at Dat Cajun Place, a restaurant in the 8500 block of Thomas Drive.

Investigators believe Whiddon continued to clean her possessions out of their shared residence at Romanza Place until approximately April 18, although Daily claims he never saw her. In late May, her loved ones realized she had disappeared. She has never been heard from again.

Whiddon left behind her two pets, her treasured golf clubs and a bonus check from work. Her gold 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck was found abandoned outside a bar, and her loved ones stated she didn't go to bars.

She lived with Daily at the time of her disappearance, but they were breaking up. He hasn't cooperated with the investigation, but he has not been named as a suspect in her disappearance.

Her brother believes Daily murdered Whiddon and buried her in his backyard. He says Daily admitted to causing her death and he got the admission recorded on tape, but the tape will is not admissible as evidence. Whiddon's brother rented an excavator and dug in Daily's yard without permission, finding nothing but causing over $1,500 in damage, and he was charged with criminal mischief as a result.

Whiddon's case remains unsolved.","https://charleyproject.org/case/kelly-allison-whiddon

She left her two young children sleeping in her car in the parking lot and walked through the building's lobby toward the swimming pool at about 05:30 a.m. A Caucasian male followed her. Witnesses heard a woman scream for help.

Atlanta Clark,"January 4, 1984","Panama City Beach, Bay County, Florida",73 years old,White,"5'4""",150 lbs.,"Clark traveled to Panama City, Florida from her home in Ontario, Canada in January 1984. She was visiting friends in Panama City at the time and checked into Continental Condominiums for her stay. She was last seen having dinner with her friends, who were staying in the same condo, three days after her arrival

Her friends reported her to authorities as a missing person when they failed to locate Clark on January 4, 1984. Her condominium was searched by investigators shortly thereafter.

Clark had left all her belongings behind, as well as a note insinuating she might have taken her own life. No other evidence was located. She has never been heard from again.

Clark's case was reopened by Panama City authorities in 1997. Another search of the area was conducted with cadaver dogs at that time, but Clark was not recovered. Investigators sent Clark's possible suicide note to the United Secret Service in 1997 for handwriting analysis, to determine whether she had in fact written it herself. The results have not been released.

In March 2000, an inmate in a Florida prison wrote a letter to a friend saying he had killed Clark. Police investigated his account and concluded the man was not, in fact, involved in Clark's disappearance. A woman matching Clark's description died in a New York City hospital in May 2000, but it turned out she was not the missing woman.

She has never been heard from again.

There were no signs of a struggle in or around her residence and nothing appeared to have been taken, but her bedroom light and the front door floodlight were left on. The house was locked, except for one window in the spare bedroom. Ali's vehicle was left in her driveway with her purse and work keys inside, but her house keys and car keys were missing.

Ali and her husband, James Gilmore, were having marital problems at the time she went missing. He had moved out of their home and she was seeing another man. Ali wanted to try to reconcile with James and the couple was undergoing counseling together.

They had a counseling appointment together for the day after Ali's disappearance, but both of them missed it. That day, James left a message at his wife's workplace, apologizing for missing the session and saying he had overslept. James has passed a voice stress test about Ali's disappearance and has cooperated fully with investigators.

Authorities believe Ali disappeared under suspicious circumstances and may have met with foul play.

She was excited and happy about the upcoming birth of her baby and believed she would get back together with James, and her loved ones describe her as a responsible person who would not have left without telling anyone. Ali had had a miscarriage once before and was especially careful with her pregnancy as a result; for instance, she did not want to carry heavy items or walk up stairs.

Ali is a graduate of Jupiter High School and Florida A&M University. At the time of her disappearance, she worked for the Florida Department of Health and part time for the Publix bakery. Her case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/2296?nav

Danielle Tamara Brown,"February 5, 2010","Talllahassee, Florida",21 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 2"" (62 Inches)",130 lbs,"Brown was last seen leaving her residence in the 7200 block of Springhill Road in Tallahassee, Florida at 8:30 p.m. on February 5, 2010. She was driving her father's silver 1994 Buick LeSabre with the Florida license plate number 694YBX. She was with her ex-boyfriend, Elijah James III, at the time. A photo of James is posted with this case summary.

Brown's last contact was when she spoke with a friend on her cellular phone at 11:35 p.m. She said she was dropping James off at his mother's home in the 7000 block of King Post Way in Miccosukkee, Florida. Brown has never been heard from again.

On February 8, Brown's car was found abandoned at the Pavo City Refuse Site in Pavo, Georgia. The vehicle's license plate, vehicle identification number and one armrest had been removed and the interior had been intentionally burned; an accelerant was used. There was no sign of Brown at the scene, but her blood was on the driver's seat, on the driver's side window and in the trunk.

James had been seen driving the car after her disappearance, and he was charged with arson in Georgia and grand theft in Florida. Later, the theft charge was dropped, as authorities aren't sure which state state he was in when he stole the car.

On February 15, Brown's cellular phone and pieces of her driver's license turned up on the roadside in Beachton, Georgia, just over the Florida state line. The other belongings she carried are still missing. Authorities reclassified Brown's case from a missing person to a homicide a month after her disappearance.

James and Brown met about five years before her disappearance. He lived with her for six months in 2007, until he was arrested for cocaine possession and incarcerated for fifteen months. He admitted he had a drug problem. After his release, he violated probation when he tested positive for marijuana in June 2009 and was jailed until November. Brown's friends stated they weren't romantically involved when she disappeared and she was only trying to assist him with his life.

James was convicted of the arson of Brown's car in February 2011. A short time later, he was charged with her murder. He was tried in the spring of 2013. The prosecution introduced DNA evidence from Brown's car and from a shovel James had bought the day after her disappearance; her blood was on the blade.

James was convicted of second-degree murder; the prosecution had sought a first-degree murder verdict and the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Brown graduated from the North Florida Cosmetology Institute. Prior to her disappearance, she maintained daily contact with her family. It's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning and foul play is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/40645?nav

A sketch of him is posted with this case summary. The abductor has never been identified. Authorities found no sign of forced entry to Osteen's house.

Tiffany Louise Sessions,"February 9, 1989","Gainesville, Florida",20 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 3"" - 5' 5"" (63 - 65 Inches)",125 lbs,"Tiffany was a junior at the University of Florida in Gainesville in 1989; she majored in finance. She resided in the 2600 block of southwest 35th Place in Casablanca East Condominiums. Tiffany told her roommate she was going to take a walk along Williston Road at approximately 6:00 p.m. on February 9, 1989.

Witnesses saw a woman matching Tiffany's description speaking to several unidentified individuals in a vehicle shortly afterwards. The woman may have entered the car, but the witnesses were uncertain. Authorities have never confirmed if the person was Tiffany. She has never been heard from again. She left her wallet, keys and identification inside her residence.

Michael Christopher Knickbocker was considered a possible suspect in Tiffany's case for many years. He was sentenced to five terms of life in prison in 1990 for the 1989 rape of a 20-year-old Gainesville college student. He had a prior record for sex offenses and other crimes.

He allegedly told other inmates that he chained Tiffany to a tree near Gainesville on the night of her disappearance. Knickbocker claimed that he murdered her shortly afterwards and disposed of her remains in the Caloosahatchee River near Fort Myers.

Investigators searched the area, but no evidence was found at the scene. Authorities stated that materials connected to Tiffany's disappearance may have been lost in the surf as a result of the time lapse. But it may be worth noting that Knickerbocker lived near the victim he killed and near the scene of his prior rape, but he wasn't living in Gainesville when Tiffany disappeared.

Knickbocker also mentioned that Tiffany's sweatshirt was buried outside of Gainesville. Investigators searched the specified location in August 2002 and recovered a piece of blood-soaked material. Authorities tested the material to determine if Tiffany's DNA was on the item. The results have not been publicly announced. Several media outlets reported that the material did not appear to originate from a sweatshirt.

In February 2014, nearly 25 years after Tiffany's disappearance, a suspect was named in her kidnapping and presumed murder: Paul Rowles. He had been sentenced to life in prison for a 1976 murder in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was released from prison in 1985.

In 1994, he was sentenced on multiple nineteen counts including sexual battery, attempted sexual battery, kidnapping and lewd and lascivious molestation. He died of natural causes in 2013 at the age of 64, still in prison.

Investigators believe Rowles was a serial killer and Tiffany was his second victim. They're searching for her body near the site where his other known murder victim was buried. Shortly after his death, DNA linked him to the unsolved murder of a 21-year-old woman whose body was found in a shallow grave only about a mile from where Tiffany disappeared.

He is known to have delivered scaffolding to a construction project along Tiffany's jogging path. Authorities also found a day planner Rowles kept in prison which, while it did not mention Tiffany's name, did have the number 2 written next to the date of her disappearance.

The Rolex company has ""flagged"" Tiffany's watch, so they will be notified if anyone tries to sell or pawn it. The watch can be identified by its unique serial number. Tiffany's case remains unsolved. There have not been any arrests in connection to her disappearance.

Jacquelyn Lorraine Markham,"December 14, 2000","Callahan, Florida",51 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 0"" (60 Inches)",100 - 110 lbs,"Markham was last seen at the Eckerd Pharmacy near her residence in Callahan, Florida shortly before 7:00 p.m. on December 14, 2000; she went there to pick up a prescription. She was scheduled to meet her boyfriend, Archie Carroll, for a date later in the evening.

Carroll told authorities that Markham called him just before he left to pick her up at her residence. She said that a male acquaintance had arrived at her house unexpectedly and that he had been drinking.

Carroll told her that he was still coming over, as he refused to let the other individual ruin their date. Markham agreed, but told Carroll to control his temper. She and the man had both disappeared by the time Carroll arrived at her residence.

Carroll said that he was initially not concerned, as he thought Markham had driven the other man's home to avoid a possible confrontation with Carroll. Markham's vehicle was located in her garage shortly thereafter. Carroll called her family members and the authorities when she did not return by the following day.

All of Markham's personal belongings were located inside of her residence, and her car was in the garage with the medicine she'd bought lying on the passenger seat. Her family stated that it is extremely uncharacteristic of Markham to leave without warning. She was scheduled to attend a family party in Tampa, Florida the afternoon after she vanished, but never called or arrived as planned.

Markham's purse was discovered in a ditch outside of Berman Brothers Inc. on Evergreen Avenue in Jacksonville, Florida sometime after her disappearance. All of her credit cards and identification were found inside the purse.

The purse was found fifteen miles from her home and several blocks from an abandoned railroad boxcar which served as Ross Lane Emerson's residence at the time. Emerson was eventually charged with the murders of two individuals in Florida and named a suspect in a man's death in Georgia after December 2000.

A photo of Emerson is posted with this case summary. Investigators questioned him regarding Markham's case after he was apprehended. Emerson maintained his innocence in her disappearance. He committed suicide in his jail cell in Florida in October 2001.

Emerson stated in his suicide note that he was not involved in Markham's case. Authorities and Markham's family believe that he was most likely telling the truth.

Markham was employed as a dispatcher at Cheetah Transportation in Jacksonville, Florida in 2000. She left behind three adult children as well as grandchildren. She kept in regular touch with her loved ones by cellular phone and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.

Her family stated she was behaving normally at the time of her disappearance and in an upbeat frame of mind. Markham's case remains unsolved, but foul play is suspected in her disappearance.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/19671/details?nav

He told police she had been living with him for several months prior to her disappearance, and that when she needed money she would work as a prostitute on U.S. 1 in Hilliard.

Police got information that Maxwell was suffering from cancer and had gone to a hospital in DeFuniak Springs, Florida for treatment, but the lead didn't pan out.

Joleen Rebecca Cummings,"May 12, 2018","Fernandina Beach, Florida",33 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 2"" (62 Inches)",120 - 160 lbs,"Cummings was last seen at her hairstylist job at Tangles Salon in Fernandina Beach, Florida on May 12, 2018. Her shift ended at 5:00 p.m.

She was supposed to meet her ex-husband in Hilliard, Florida the next day to pick up their three children for Mother's Day, which also happened to be her thirty-fourth birthday. She but never arrived to get them, however, and has never been heard from again. Her mother reported her missing on May 14.

The last person known to have seen Cummings was Jennifer Marie Sybert, another stylist at the salon, who had worked there for only about a month. A photo of Sybert is posted with this case summary. When police went to the salon to question Sybert on May 14, they discovered she hadn't shown up for work that day. The home address she'd given the salon owner turned out to be fake.

On May 15, Cummings's car was located in a parking lot on Florida A1A near a Home Depot store in Yulee, Florida. A photo of the vehicle, a beige 2006 Ford Expedition with the Florida license plate number 035KBQ, is posted with this case summary. Surveillance camera footage showed it being parked at that location at 1:17 a.m. on May 13, just seven hours after Cummings would have left work. The driver was not Cummings, but Sybert.

A photo of her is posted with this case summary. On the evening of May 16, she was located sleeping in her own car at a rest area on Interstate 95 in St. Johns County, Florida and charged with grand theft auto, based on the video showing her driving Cummings's car. At the time of her arrest she had injuries on her hands, arms and thighs, and a patch of hair missing from her head.

Authorities learned ""Sybert"" had been living under a false name, Social Security number and identification. She had taken the name ""Jennifer Marie Sybert"" from the gravestone of a sixteen-year-old girl who died in a car crash in Germany in 1987 and was buried in Butler, Pennsylvania. Her real name is Kimberly Lee Kessler and she had disappeared from Butler in 2004, but wasn't reported missing until 2012.

A look into her past revealed she had used at least seventeen alias names and lived in thirty-three cities in fourteen different states since 1996, often drawing names from gravestones in the same cemetery in Butler. She was charged with possession of a counterfeit passport, a federal offense.

People who knew Kessler described her as secretive and paranoid. Clients at Tangles Salon stated there was tension between her and Cummings, who didn't like her. Just days before her disappearance, Cummings told a coworker that she believed Kessler was ""not the person that she says she is"" and that she planned to start digging into her background.

In September 2018, Kessler was charged with first-degree premeditated murder in Cummings's case. Investigators believe Cummings was murdered inside the salon the same night she disappeared.

After Kessler dropped Cummings's car off, authorities learned, she walked to a nearby gas station, bought a bottle of water, and used an employee's phone to call for a taxi. The gas station employee noted she had several scratches on her face that looked like finger marks, and surveillance footage from the station also showed this. The taxi driver said she spoke to him about religion, and he dropped her off next to Tangles Salon a half mile away and saw her get into her own car.

Police found bloodstains at Tangles Salon, including on two chairs, and on the walls, cabinets and in the sink drain, and on a signboard, a display stand, a vacuum cleaner, a bleach bottle and a mop. Some of the blood was Cummings's, and some was from Kessler. Someone had tried to clean up the scene by mopping blood off the floor.

Police also recovered a bloodstained blue tote bag that Kessler had thrown into the woods. Blood found on Kessler's boot, a sock, a pair of scissors, and in a storage locker Kessler rented all was proved to be from Cummings, and one of Cummings's fingernails was also found inside a bin in the storage unit.

On May 4, over a week before Cummings disappeared, Kessler had searched on her phone about how to tie a tourniquet and how to inject someone with something. She also searched on her phone for the phrase ""coworker guilty of murder missing person body not found"" and made 457 searches containing Cummings's name over a 48-hour period. Kessler bought large-sized zip ties at a boating supply store on May 5. Police also found a Walmart receipt for 30-gallon trash bags, an electric knife, and a bottle of ammonia.

Based on surveillance video of Kessler depositing a white trash bag and emptying the contents of a trash can in a dumpster near Tangles Salon the weekend of Cummings's disappearance, investigators looked for her body at a landfill in Charlton County, Georgia. They located several items of interest, but not Cummings's body.

Kessler is awaiting trial in the murder. Her defense attorney believes she's incompetent to stand trial and a psychiatrist agrees, but the prosecution is seeking a second opinion.

Cummings's body has never been found.

She was driving her boyfriend's Chevrolet Camaro, which she had trouble starting when she left; it kept stalling.

The car apparently stalled again on the San Francisco Bay Bridge sometime during the evening. Another car collided with Toni's vehicle prior to 12:00 a.m. Police arrived just six minutes later, and found that Toni was not inside the vehicle after the accident.

Assuming that the impact of the collision swept her into the water below, the U.S. Coast Guard dragged the bottom of the Bay. Toni was not located and neither were her clothes. No blood, hair or oil residue was found in her vehicle either.

Her mother has stated that she received a phone call approximately one week after Toni disappeared from a young woman she believes was her daughter. The girl was crying on the line for approximately 40 seconds before the call was terminated; authorities were unable to trace the source.

The majority of officials maintain that Toni drowned the night of the car accident, but her case remains classified as that of a missing person.

Some witnesses reported seeing an African-American man looking under the Camaro. Others saw the man leaving the scene. No one saw Toni's body going over the bridge railing. Her bracelet, which she never removed, was found on the passenger side floorboard along with her car keys.

The man who ran into Toni's car was tried for vehicular manslaughter, but acquitted for lack of evidence proving Toni was in fact dead.

Some reports may state that Toni resided in San Bruno, California. She was a high school senior in 1990. She enjoyed swimming and dancing, and ran on her school track team. Her case remains unsolved and is classified as a possible non-family abduction. Toni was two months pregnant at the time of her disappearance.

Stephanie Ray Clemons,"May 20, 2018","Miramar, Florida",54,African American / Black,"5'4""",130 lbs,"Clemons was last seen outside her residence in Miramar, Florida on May 2o, 2018. She was on her way to work at Jackson Memorial Medical Center, where she was a phlebotomist, but never arrived there and has never been heard from again.

Her car keys, house keys and cellular phone disappeared with her. She left her red 2018 Volkswagen Jetta behind her home with her wallet inside; it contained credit cards and $300 in cash. She also left her driver's license and passport behind.

When police checked Clemons's home in the 7200 block of Venetian Street, they found food in a pot on the stove, and a fan and television set on in the bedroom. They didn't find any blood or evidence of foul play. It's uncharacteristic of her to miss work; she had a near-perfect attendance record.

Clemons had been in a relationship with Jack Freeman Jr., and he was the father of one of her four children. A photo of Freeman is posted with this case summary. Authorities learned they had married in 2016, something Clemons's relatives and loved ones were unaware of.

He had been seeing another woman for about ten years, something he says Clemons knew about, and he said he'd moved in to his girlfriend's apartment in the 2400 block of Sherman Circle north in late April. He failed a polygraph about Clemons's case, showing deception on all of his answers.

Police stated there were 22 separate reports of domestic violence by Freeman against Clemons and other women but he wasn't charged in any of the cases. He was arrested five times on domestic violence charges between 2000 and 2017, but each time the case was dropped. He was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon in 2007, but that charge was also dropped.

Freeman initially stated he hadn't had contact with Clemons for about a month prior to her disappearance, then changed his story and it had actually been more than two months since he'd seen her. In fact, they'd been in touch, at least by text, up until her disappearance.

The DSS decided neither of her parents were fit and at first placed her with Samora's grandmother, then in foster care. In June, LaShawnda was placed in the care of Ogletree's mother, Barbara Brown, in River Rouge, Michigan.

On August 1, 1991, while Brown was at work and her teenage daughter was babysitting, Ogletree took the baby from the house without permission. Later that day he called Samora and asked her to listen on the phone. She thought she heard him shaking and choking LaShawnda, and called the police, who began looking for Ogletree and the child.

Samora saw him three or four more times afterwards and each time he promised to take her to where LaShawnda was, then went back on his promise. He gave conflicting stories as to what happened and whether the baby was alive or dead.

On September 7, Ogletree was arrested in Detroit for parental kidnapping. LaShawnda wasn't with him and he refused to disclose her whereabouts. After his arrest, he told both Samora and Brown that he'd lost his temper and killed the baby.

The outcome of the parental kidnapping case against Ogletree is unknown. LaShawnda has never been located.",https://charleyproject.org/case/lashawnda-patrice-coates,-83.137663,42.2742611

",150 lbs - 170 lbs,"Chelsea Cobo was last seen in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on May 6, 2016. She has never been heard from again.

She had been raised by her aunt, who legally adopted her. Her biological mother died in March 2016 and afterwards, Cobo became depressed and checked herself into the psychiatric ward for two weeks. She became friendly with her hospital roommate, who had a regular male visitor named Justice. After her release from the hospital, Cobo began socializing with her former roommate and Justice.

After one outing, on April 26, Cobo came home in the early morning hours disoriented and bruised. Her aunt took her to the hospital, who performed a rape kit and had her tested for drugs. They determined Cobo had been drugged, robbed and sexually assaulted that night, but she couldn't remember where she'd been or who she had been with.

On May 6, Cobo told her aunt she wanted to check herself into a drug rehabilitation program. Her aunt dropped her off at the hospital, and a van was supposed to take her to a rehab program in Yonkers, New York. It took hours to get there, and during that time, Cobo was texting her friends and asking them to pick her up in Yonkers so she could get drugs.

Justice stated he picked Cobo up in Yonkers on May 6 and brought her back to Brooklyn, dropping her off on 68th Street in Sunset Park. She may have been seen leaving the La Florita club and restaurant on Fifth Avenue and Sunset Park at 1:45 a.m. May 7; she was reportedly accompanied by a friend of Justice, a man named Antonio, at the time.

Cobo's aunt fears she was a victim of human trafficking and may be being held against her will and forced to work as a prostitute somewhere in New York City. Due to her history of drug use and mental illness, she's considered to be in danger. Her case remains unsolved. 

 Cobo suffers from bipolar disorder, depression, substance abuse issues and borderline personality disorder. She was hospitalized for her problems shortly before her disappearance, and may be in need of medical attention.",https://charleyproject.org/case/chelsea-michelle-cobo,-74.0097326,40.6454942

Her phone records indicate the phone was in use and she was home until about 8:00 p.m. She has never been heard from again. When authorities searched her home on July 29, investigators found blood on a mattress.

In June, the month her disappearance, Coe had gotten a restraining order against Gregory Erhardt, a man she'd been dating. She applied for the order on June 16 and it was granted on June 29, and was set to expire in the summer of 2016. Coe stated she was afraid of Erhardt and that he had threatened to kill her in her sleep. He has a criminal record dating back to the 1980s, including felony convictions for assault and unlawful restraint. In August 2015, Erhardt was arrested for violating the order. He admitted he'd contacted Coe prior to her disappearance and had met with in a supermarket the week she went missing.

In October, additional charges were filed against him for felony assault and misdemeanor reckless endangerment. These charges stem from an incident with Coe on June 26, three weeks before her disappearance. According to court documents, Erhardt stabbed her in the neck with scissors. She didn't seek medical attention right away, but did go to a walk-in clinic with her daughter and son-in-law for treatment after they saw the injury. The blood police found on Coe's mattress was apparently from the June 26 attack.

Due to her health issues, Coe is considered to be at risk.

All their belongings were left behind. Investigators initially believed they'd run away from home, but as time passed without anyone seeing or hearing from the sisters, they began to suspect foul play.

Joyce and Josephine's father was killed in a car accident in 1968. Their mother was pregnant with Joyce at the time, and Josephine was an infant. She gave the two girls to their paternal grandparents; their older sister, Rosetta, went to her maternal grandmother.

The sisters were reunited in 1975, after their mother remarried. She made her second husband leave their home over allegations that he'd tried to molest Joyce and Josephine. In 1983, Joyce and Josephine were having disciplinary problems at home in Broken Bow, Oklahoma. They left and moved in with the family friend in Norman. He was granted temporary custody of them.

",120 lbs - 130 lbs,"Rose was enrolled in the Synanon Foundation, a drug and alcohol treatment center in Oakland, California, at the time of her disappearance. She had been court-ordered there after running away repeatedly and telling a judge she used and sold drugs.

Accounts of exactly when she went missing vary considerably; it may have been anytime between the fall of 1972 and the summer of 1973.

Rose apparently ran away from the Synanon and sent two letters to her family after leaving, assuring them that she was fine. In one of the letters she said she was living on the streets in the Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco and added that she was sick with a kidney infection.

Rose wrote she would not write to her family again until she was 18, because she was worried the Synanon officials would find her and bring her back to the treatment center against her will.

She promised to contact her loved ones after she became a legal adult. However, Rose's family never heard from her again.

It is worth noting that the Synanon Foundation has often been labeled as a cult. It was founded as a drug rehabilitation program in 1958 and became an alternative community by the 1960s and a church by the 1970s.

Participants were expected to turn all of their assets over to the group and join the community for life. Those who left the group were often persecuted and even beaten as a result. The IRS shut the Synanon Foundation down in 1989.

There is no evidence that a crime was committed in Rose's disappearance; her case is classified as a simple runaway. However, it is highly unusual for a runaway to be out of touch with her loved ones for this long, and her relatives would like to get in contact with her and verify her well-being.

A local resident's surveillance video showed her leaving her home. Instead of getting into her car, she walked past it, across the street and out of frame.

She was dressed in her postal uniform, but she never arrived at the post office where she worked as a city carrier assistant, and she had actually called in sick that day. She has never been heard from again.

Her car was found parked on the block where she lived, with her purse, cellular phone, prenatal vitamins and lunch bag still inside. It's uncharacteristic of her to go without contacting her family or using her social media accounts.

Coles's family stated she was excited about her pregnancy and looking forward to the birth of the baby, her first. She had moved to her apartment a few months earlier, and also had bought a new car. The father of her child is Joshua Simmons, her boyfriend of five years. He has another partner, however, and they have children, and she was also pregnant when Coles disappeared.

Police stated they had ""a pretty good idea of what transpired"" and that they believed Coles met with foul play. They have multiple persons of interest in her case. It remains unsolved.

She has never been heard from again. Her car was found abandoned at the bar, packed full of her belongings, including her purse. The exact date of her disappearance is unknown.

Pry had a high-risk lifestyle; she had been addicted to heroin since her teens, and was involved in prostitution to support her habit. She frequently stole, including from clients, to pay for drugs. The Last Chance Bar where she was last seen was notorious for its prostitution activity, and was eventually shut down by the state. Her sister stated Pry was frequently beaten by her pimp, a violent man who was involved in a variety of criminal activities. They had a young daughter together, and Pry's sister stated she would not have abandoned the child deliberately.

After she disappeared, her family hired a private detective to search for her. An anonymous caller threatened Pry's father, saying that if he didn't stop searching for Pry, one of her four sisters would be taken too.

Ida Dean Richardson-Anderson,"September 18, 1958","Detroit, MI",21,White,"5'2""",110 lbs,"Ida Richardson resided with her family in Florida in the mid-1950s. She became pregnant in 1955 at age 18 and married her baby's father, Kenneth Gerald Anderson (nicknamed ""Jerry"") shortly thereafter. Kenneth was employed part-time as a musician. They settled in the Detroit, Michigan area and had two additional children by 1958.

The marriage was troubled and Ida often wrote about financial difficulties in letters to her relatives in Florida. Ida took her three children and left Kenneth in February 1958. She was hospitalized due to rheumatic fever and ulcers shortly afterwards.

Kenneth placed the children in a boarding home while Ida was ill. The state of Michigan took custody of their children as a result of his actions and Ida and Kenneth spent the next six months attempting to regain their parental rights.

Ida was scheduled to receive custody of her children in mid-September 1958, but no one is certain if she was aware of that fact. She vanished on September 18 and has never been heard from again.

Ida's children were adopted by other families due to her disappearance. Her oldest son and daughter were adopted by the same family and their names were changed to Dan Borgers and Beverly Borgers. The two siblings were raised in Fraser, Michigan. Ida's youngest daughter was adopted by a family residing in Michigan's Upper Pennisula and was renamed Deborah Lindeman.

Arrangements had been made for Ida and the children to fly to Jacksonville, Florida after she was awarded custody in 1958. Airplane tickets had been purchased, but they were never used.

Ida's three children were reunited in 1995 and began searching for her with the assistance of other relatives.

Ida has not been located as an unidentified deceased victim and a search of hospital records has proven that she was not admitted to any facilities in Michigan and surrounding states after her 1958 disappearance under her own name. Her family is concerned that she may have been institutionalized or that she is homeless and does not know her identity. Ida's case remains unsolved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/2485

Khristine Renee Smith,"September 28, 1994","Portage, MI",27,White,"5'5""",120 lbs,"Khristine Smith was last seen on September 28, 1994 in Portage, Michigan. Her husband, Russell Smith, told everyone she had left voluntarily with another man. He showed people a note of explanation which he claimed she had written. Khristine's loved ones did not believe him, however; they did not think she would have abandoned her seven-year-old daughter.

At first police thought Khristine had in fact left Russell, but they began to suspect foul play after Russell refused to let them search his home or speak to his daughter alone. In late 1994, authorities got a warrant to search the Smith residence. They discovered no physical evidence of murder, but they did find items that led them to charge Russell with embezzlement from his employer.

Russell and Khristine's daughter was removed from their home at this time when evidence surfaced that Russell may have been molesting her. He was never charged in connection with the alleged abuse, but his daughter was adopted by his parents and never lived with him again. The girl told police that her parents had argued on the day of Khristine's disappearance and she found blood in the upstairs bathroom, which Russell remodeled later that year.

Russell pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in connection to Khristine's case in 1998. He confessed that after they put their child on the school bus, they began to argue and Khristine threatened to leave with their daughter.

Russell stated he shot Khristine to death, put her body in a storage barrel, and threw the barrel in Lake Erie, which is about nine miles from their residence. He maintained that he was driven to kill her by her selfishness, meanness, and frequent affairs with other men. (Investigators could find no evidence that Khristine had ever been unfaithful with anyone during her marriage.)

Russell agreed to help detectives find her body, but searches of the lake turned up nothing. He was sentenced to 35 to 70 years in prison for his wife's murder.

Khristine's remains have never been found.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/22568

They know she traveled to southern California and stayed in the San Bernardino, Riverside and/or San Diego areas. She may have been staying in homeless shelters. Her family hasn't heard from her since 1979.

Authorities have learned that Collier was in San Diego, California in 2004, and they obtained a 2004 photograph of her. She may have moved to the east coast of Florida sometime in 2008 or 2009.

Her current whereabouts are unknown, her case is still open and the police and her family are still looking for her. California police are investigating.

Racine Lamour Taliaferro,"April 26, 2014","Detroit, MI",27,Black,"4'11""",135 lbs,"Taliaferro was last seen in Detroit, Michigan on April 26, 2014. She lived with her boyfriend, Johnathon Michael McMahen, at the time of her disappearance

McMahen was a member of the Satan's Sidekicks Motorcycle Club. According to the club rules, only men can be members, and women are considered to be property of the men. While she was seeing him, Taliaferro was also intimately involved with other men, including at least one other member of the motorcycle club. Her relationship with the other club member was widely known within the club.

Taliaferro was last seen while in a heated argument with McMahen at the club headquarters in the 48300 block of east Davidson between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. They got into an altercation in the restroom which turned physical. Taliaferro was heard telling McMahen she didn't want to leave the club with him, and McMahen tried to pull her out of the club.

She removed the motorcycle colors she had been wearing, clothes which proclaimed her to be McMahen's property, and seemed very angry and afraid. Witnesses saw McMahen pin her to the floor with a knife at her neck. Later, the couple went outside and Taliaferro sat in the passenger seat of McMahen's black GMC Jimmy pickup truck. McMahen stood in front of her, blocking her exit, and they continued to argue.

When Taliaferro's best friend, Alfreda Robinson, tried to approach them, McMahen wouldn't let her speak to Taliaferro. Robinson went back inside the clubhouse for about twenty minutes, and when she came out, they were both gone. McMahen returned to the clubhouse alone about forty-five minutes later.

During the early morning hours of April 27, McMahen awakened his Merry Wade and Jason Wedel, both of whom were staying with him and Taliaferro, and asked them to leave the house so he could speak privately to Taliaferro. Wedel never saw or heard Taliaferro in the house that morning, but he assumed she was asleep in her bedroom. While Wade was waiting for someone to pick her up from the house, she tried to call Taliaferro twice, but both calls went to voicemail.

When Wedel called McMahen later that day, McMahen told him he had broken up with Taliaferro and kicked her out of the house. That afternoon, McMahen went to a T-Mobile store and sold Taliaferro's phone. Wade came back to the house on April 28 to get some belongings, but when she tried to go into the basement to get them, McMahen stopped her and went into the basement himself to fetch what she wanted.

Wedel didn't return until April 30, and when he did, McMahen told him Taliaferro had three days to collect her belongings and that he would be moving a new girlfriend in after that. Taliaferro never did come back to the home, though, and Wedel helped McMahen move her things into the abandoned home next door. They were later recovered by the police.

In the days following Taliaferro's disappearance, McMahen contacted Randy Hendricks, who regularly cleaned his home, and asked him to clean his basement with bleach and water. For safety reasons, Hendricks refused. While he was cleaning, he found dried blood on McMahen's bedroom door.

Robinson repeatedly tried to contact Taliaferro by phone, but she never saw or heard from her again after April 26, and neither did any of her other friends or her family. Robinson eventually filed a missing persons report for her.

Paisley Almore, McMahen's ex-girlfriend, spoke to him several times about Taliaferro's disappearance after she found out about it in May. When she asked him about some bloody clothes at the abandoned home next to his, he told her Taliaferro's clothes were bloody because ""when you choke someone and they take their last breath the person coughs up blood.""

He told her he and Taliaferro had gotten into a fight after he found out about her infidelity. At first he said Taliaferro had jumped out of his car, but after Almore challenged him, he admitted he had choked her in his car.

He said when they got home and he got out of the car and she didn't follow him, he assumed that Taliaferro, who was drunk, had passed out. When he went back to try to help her, he realized she was dead. McMahen told Almore that he put Taliaferro's body in the back of his truck and then dumped the body in a building, but didn't say where. He said he thought he would get away with it because ""with no body there's no case.""

McMahen was arrested for Taliaferro's murder and tried later in 2014. At his trial, a cellmate testified that McMahen had confessed the crime to him, telling the same story he told Almore. The county medical examiner testified that McMahen's statement about Taliaferro coughing up blood as she was choked was consistent with what would happen during strangulation.

McMahen was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison. Taliaferro's body has never been found in spite of extensive searches.

Jasmine Kirlissa Collins,"August 8, 1991","Akron, Ohio",7 months,African American / Black ; Caucasian / White,"1'6""",15 lbs,"Jasmine and her mother, Melissa, were last seen in Akron, Ohio on August 8, 1991. At 4:00 p.m., Melissa's mother dropped her daughter and granddaughter off at Melissa's apartment in the 100 block of Westwood Avenue. At around 7:30 p.m., Melissa and Jasmine left to walk to a grocery store four blocks from their residence. Neither of them has been seen again.

It's uncharacteristic of Melissa to be out of touch with her family; she usually spoke to her mother daily by phone. Even when she ran away for a month while she was pregnant with Jasmine, Melissa called her parents to let them know she was safe. Her mother described her as a very trusting teenager.

When her mother went to Melissa's apartment after the disappearance, she found no indications that Melissa had planned to leave with her child. Her puse was in the bedroom, her clothes were freshly washed and folded, and there was a stock of diapers for Jasmine, as well as baby bottles in the fridge. Melissa's mother doesn't believe she would have left without taking her belongings and Jasmine's baby supplies.

The last person to claim he saw Melissa and Jasmine is also the prime suspect in their cases. Raymond ""Sweet Pea"" Smith Jr. was staying with a woman who sublet her apartment to Melissa at the time. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. Smith said he saw Melissa and Jasmine leave the apartment that evening, and he himself left shortly after did. When he returned to the apartment a day or two later, his clothes were bloodstained.

Smith had a history of violence, drug abuse and mental illness, with prior convictions for crimes ranging from drug offenses, sexual imposition and aggravated assault. Melissa had told her mother she was afraid of him and that he had made unwanted advances towards her.

In February 1992, six months after Melissa and Jasmine disappeared, Smith died by suicide at the age of 37. He didn't leave a note and the motive for his suicide is unclear, but he was facing serious criminal charges and didn't want to return to prison. He was never charged in connection with the Collinses' disappearances; in fact, the police never even interviewed him about it.

The Collins cases are still unsolved, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.

At 4:00 p.m., Melissa's mother dropped her daughter and granddaughter off at Melissa's apartment in the 100 block of Westwood Avenue. At around 7:30 p.m., Melissa and Jasmine left to walk to a grocery store four blocks from their residence. Neither of them has been seen again.

It's uncharacteristic of Melissa to be out of touch with her family; she usually spoke to her mother daily by phone. Even when she ran away for a month while she was pregnant with Jasmine, Melissa called her parents to let them know she was safe. Her mother described her as a very trusting teenager.

When her mother went to Melissa's apartment after the disappearance, she found no indications that Melissa had planned to leave with her child. Her puse was in the bedroom, her clothes were freshly washed and folded, and there was a stock of diapers for Jasmine, as well as baby bottles in the fridge. Melissa's mother doesn't believe she would have left without taking her belongings and Jasmine's baby supplies.

The last person to claim he saw Melissa and Jasmine is also the prime suspect in their cases. Raymond ""Sweet Pea"" Smith Jr. was staying with a woman who sublet her apartment to Melissa at the time. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. Smith said he saw Melissa and Jasmine leave the apartment that evening, and he himself left shortly after did. When he returned to the apartment a day or two later, his clothes were bloodstained.

Smith had a history of violence, drug abuse and mental illness, with prior convictions for crimes ranging from drug offenses, sexual imposition and aggravated assault. Melissa had told her mother she was afraid of him and that he had made unwanted advances towards her.

In February 1992, six months after Melissa and Jasmine disappeared, Smith died by suicide at the age of 37. He didn't leave a note and the motive for his suicide is unclear, but he was facing serious criminal charges and didn't want to return to prison. He was never charged in connection with the Collinses' disappearances; in fact, the police never even interviewed him about it.

The Collins cases are still unsolved, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/melissa-ann-collins,-81.5074848,41.0811793
Carla Rebecca Corley,"August 12, 1980","Birmingham, Alabama",14 Years,White / Caucasian,"5' 3"" (63 Inches)",130 lbs,"Carla was last seen at her family's residence at the Eastwood public housing project on Airport Highway in Birmingham, Alabama during the evening hours of August 12, 1980. She and her mother were watching television, and then her mother went to bed.

Her mother awoke at approximately 4:30 a.m. on August 13 and discovered the doors to their apartment were wide open. Chairs had been pushed back from the living room table and a soft drink bottle had been overturned as well.

Carla's new sandals were near the couch where she had placed them the night before, and her belt was lying on the ground outside the front door. All of her belongings, including money and her medication, had been left behind. There was no sign of her inside the residence. She has never been seen again.

Carla had been allegedly abducted and raped by a group of men in July 1980, one month prior to the time she was last seen. The three-hour attack had taken place near Lake Purdy in Alabama. The men had arrived at Carla's family's residence the week before she disappeared, but they were not permitted inside.

It is not known if the previous attack is related to Carla's disappearance. No official report about the incident was filed at the time and the police didn't learn about it until eighteen years after Carla went missing. Authorities have continued to search for Carla since 1980.

Throughout the years, her mother has been the victim of many individuals attempting to cash in on her daughter's disappearance. Various people have claimed they would reveal Carla's whereabouts if a monetary amount was paid. Carla's sister stated she's been warned that she could be killed if she keeps searching for Carla; she's persisted in the search anyway.

At the time of her disappearance, Carla was about to start seventh grade and was looking forward to it. She was close to her older sister, who by then had moved out of the family home, and her sister doesn't believe she would have gone this long without contact. Their mother believes that she was sexually assaulted and murdered shortly after her disappearance.

Several years after Carla's disappearance, she was declared legally dead. A suspect claimed he knew her fate, but then he recanted his story. Her case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected in Carla's case.

Chloe Combe-Rivas,"March 15, 2006","Kansas City, Missouri",2,Caucasian / White,"2'8""",35 lbs,"Chloe was last seen in Kansas City, Missouri on March 15, 2006. She was abducted by her non-custodial mother, Aline Rivas-Vera. A felony warrant for kidnapping was issued for her on May 18, 2006.

Photographs of Aline are posted with this case summary. Her date of birth is June 22, 1980, making her 25 years old at the time of Chloe's abduction. She's described as Hispanic, with light brown hair and green eyes. Aline is a Mexican citizen. She speaks English, French and Spanish. She may use the last names Combe and/or Combe-Rivas. She may have suicidal tendencies.

At the time she abducted from Chloe, Aline was in the process of a divorce from the child's father, Didier Combe. Didier is a native of France, but became a naturalized American citizen in 2003. Aline is a Mexican citizen who was living in the United States on a student visa in 2006.

Aline and Didier shared custody of Chloe during their divorce proceedings. Aline fled with Chloe during a court-ordered visit. Didier was granted full custody of his daughter afterwards. Aline and Chloe are known to have flown to Mexico via Houston, Texas.

Didier filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines in connection with Chloe's abduction. Mexican law requires a single-parent passenger traveling alone with a minor child to present a notarized letter from the absent parent authorizing travel for that child out of the United States into Mexico. According to Didier, Continental Airlines never asked to see Aline's letter, in violation of the law and its own policies, and thus failed to prevent Chloe's abduction.

Didier has made at least six trips to Mexico to try and get Chloe returned to him. He has filed for her return under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Aline filed for full custody of her daughter in Mexican courts, but this was denied.

Aline's mother and twin brother, who both live in the Kansas City area, both traveled to Mexico City to testify against Aline and request Chloe's return to the United States.

In April 2008, a Mexican family court judge ruled that, as Chloe had been living in Mexico since 2006, she should remain there. Didier appealed, however, and in November 2009 a Mexican high court ordered Chloe's return to the United States and the care of her father.

Aline and Chloe went into hiding after the ruling, however, and their current whereabouts are unknown. They are presumed to still be in Mexico, probably in the Mexico City area, where Aline has relatives. Chloe's case remains unsolved.

Cassie Kay Compton,"September 14, 2014","Stuttgart, Arkansas",15,Caucasian / White,"5'3""",100 lbs,"Cassie was last seen in Stuttgart, Arkansas sometime after 6:00 p.m. of September 14, 2014, after spending the day at a demolition derby with friends. Her mother, Judy Compton Kimsey, was at home, sick in bed. Kimsey's then-fiance, Brandon Lee Rhodes, who lived with them, was also at home. A few minutes after Cassie arrived home from the demolition derby, she left again. She had a black LG smart phone, with no charger. She never returned home and has never been heard from again.

There are differing accounts as to what happened that evening after Cassie arrived home. One story is that Kimsey was sick in bed and Rhodes was cooking dinner when Cassie left, and that Cassie told her mother she was going to the store to get some things. Rhodes subsequently fed Kimsey dinner in bed, since she was too sick to get up.

Another account is that Rhodes told Kimsey he was going out to get cigarettes, and at the same time, Cassie texted her mother to say she was going out ""to get a smoke."" Rhodes reportedly took Kimsey's car when he left, even though he didn't have a driver's license. He was gone for several hours, and when he came back, he went into the bathroom and vomited, and stayed in there for over an hour.

A photo of Rhodes is posted with this case summary. His relationship with Kimsey ended in the weeks after Cassie went missing, and she has married another man. Rhodes and Cassie did not get along and he's considered a person of interest in her case. He has been jailed multiple times in the years since Cassie disappeared, but authorities haven't stated what, if any, evidence implicates him in her case. When he gave a media interview in 2019, he stated he never even saw Cassie after she arrived home on the day she went missing.

It's uncharacteristic of Cassie to leave without warning; her mother said they always kept in touch. She was home-schooled and working to obtain a GED certificate. At the time of her disappearance, her father lived in Oklahoma. Her case remains unsolved.

Gladys Conklin,"January 9, 1982","San Lorenzo, California",78,Caucasian / White,"5'5""",103 lbs,"Gladys was last seen in San Lorenzo, California on January 9, 1982. Her husband, Irving Conklin II, said she frequently wandered as a result of her Alzheimer's Disease, sometimes taking the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) system for transportation.

Irving kept the front gate padlocked, but on the day of her disappearance he took a nap and forgot to lock the gate. When he woke up, Gladys was gone. Her husband said he thought she went missing sometime between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. No one besides Irving said they had seen her for about 24 hours prior to her reported disappearance.

When police went to the Conklin house to take the missing persons report, they noticed the yard had been freshly tilled. Irving said it had been routine gardening. Authorities also discovered Irving had withdrawn $20,000 from the couple's bank account just before Gladys disappeared; he said the money was to put her in a nursing home.

Those who knew the Conklins stated Irving and Gladys were devoted to each other. Although many people, including Irving's own son, theorized he had murdered his wife, friends of the family thought he might have done so to spare her from suffering the slow decline of Alzheimer's Disease rather than out of malice.

Irving died in 1988; he was never charged in Gladys's disappearance.

Gladys and Irving operated a goat farm in Oregon for a decade after their 1934 marriage, then moved to California. Gladys was the first children's librarian in Hayward, California; she took the position in 1950. She wrote 25 children's books about insects and other nature topics, and they sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

She went to take the dog for a walk along the railroad tracks of the Montauk branch train of the Long Island Railroad. The dog returned home without her just a few minutes later, with its collar and leash still on.

Earlier on the day of her disappearance, Cynthia and her brother had gone into the woods and seen a muskrat den, and she said she wanted to go back and find the muskrat. Three young boys said they'd seen Cynthia going into the woods with her dog, and when her brother lead authorities to the muskrat hole, they found tracks consistent with Cynthia and the dog. The tracks were wiped out by rain before they could be closely examined or preserved, however.

Cynthia has never been heard from again. She didn't take any belongings with her, and at the time of her disappearance her rabbit was about to give birth and she was looking forward to seeing the babies. Her family never believed she ran away; they thought she was abducted.

The police considered Cynthia's father a possibly suspect in her disappearance. He had a bicycle shop on Montauk Highway in Oakdale, and laid a new cement floor in the basement around the time of Cynthia's disappearance.

Several local people were suggested as potential suspects, but no one has been charged or named publicly. It's worth noting that she disappeared near the train station, and could have encountered numerous people there who weren't local to the area.

Cynthia's parents are both dead, but her brother is still alive. Her case remains unsolved.

April was being supervised by a neighbor, William James Bannister, at the time she disappeared. He was employed as a truck driver from Colorado in 1986. He had offered to babysit her when she and her mother went to work at an Old Town Temecula thrift store in Temecula, California that day. He said he gave April $5 to play video games at the arcade and she never returned home.

The day after April's disappearance, Bannister went to his father's wedding reception in dirt-caked clothes. He told the other attendees that he had gotten dirty while participating in the search for April. (In fact, he was not part of the search efforts.) He spoke to his father privately, then left the reception a short time afterward. That evening, Bannister's father told his new wife that Bannister had ""done it again.""

Bannister had killed his girlfriend in San Diego, California in 1978, and served five years in prison for second-degree murder in that case. He was released from prison in 1984.

After April's disappearance, in 1993, he tried to strangle his son's fourteen-year-old girlfriend in the back of his truck and was sentenced to sixteen years for attempted murder. When police searched the truck for evidence in that case, they found jewelry, bloodstained women's undergarments and several ligatures.

Bannister was charged with April's presumed homicide in 1995, nine years after she disappeared. He was extradited from Colorado to California for the trial. Investigators believed that he killed April as part of a brutal sexual fantasy, then concealed her remains.

His father was deceased by then, but Bannister's son testified that, in 1989, Bannister had told him April was dead. Bannister allegedly stated April fell off a rock and broke her neck while they were hiking together. He was convicted of her murder in 1998 and sentenced to life in prison without parole in early 1999.

Authorities believe Bannister may have also been involved in the disappearance of Laurie Lucas, a Colorado woman who vanished in 1990, but he has never faced charges in that case.

April's body has never been located. She was a first-grade student at Cottonwood Elementary School in December 1986. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/april-ann-cooper,-117.1201846,33.4918757

He had died of a heart attack at age 46. He was carrying a .38 caliber pistol and a bloodstained pillowcase containing $98,000, all of it in hundred-dollar bills.

Nearly a mile away was the body of Florence Evelyn Richina, a 49-year-old former special education teacher; she'd been shot with a .38 caliber pistol. James's footprints led from the crime scene to his truck. Richina had sold some land and withdrawn $98,000 from her bank account, and that same amount of cash was in the pillowcase with James's body. Some of Richina's personal belongings and jewelry were found hidden in James's home. There were reports that they were going to get married, but authorities could find no marriage license or other evidence to support the stories.

Foul play is suspected in the disappearances of the four women. Their cases remain unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/jacqueline-cooper,-120.9970014,37.6392595

Her family members advised her not to go because of her illness, but she went anyway. She arrived at Newark International Airport in Newark, New Jersey on March 13 and checked into the Belvedere Hotel on west 48th Street in the borough of Manhattan.

Cosgrove lost her travel bag, which contained her passport and return plane ticket, the same day she arrived in the United States. She was disoriented and confused throughout her stay, forgetting the name of her hotel and once going to the wrong hotel.

Cosgrove was last seen leaving the Belvedere Hotel on March 18; she planned to go to the airport and report the loss of her bag. She never got on her return flight to Scotland and has never been heard from again. Her family reported her as a missing person on March 21, the day she was supposed to have arrived home.

Cosgrove used a credit card to check into the Belvedere Hotel, but the card has not been used since she disappeared and no money has been withdrawn from her bank account. She is believed to have been carrying about $600 in cash when she went missing. She left some of her belongings behind at her hotel room, but the items contained no clues as to her whereabouts.

Eight months after Cosgrove's disappearance, her missing passport was mailed from the British embassy in Washington, D.C. to a passport office in Peterborough, England. They forwarded it to Cosgrove's home in Scotland. Authorities do not know who found the passport initially or where it was found.

Foul play is not suspected in Cosgrove's disappearance, but her fate is unclear. Her family in the United Kingdom believes she may be homeless or deceased.

Cosgrove suffers from a rare degenerative brain condition called frontotemporal dementia or Pick's Disease. It's characterized by personality changes, poor judgement, forgetfulness, social ineptitude and dementia. Many Pick's Disease symptoms are similar to those of Alzheimer's Disease. The illness, which renders its victims vulnerable to opportunistic infections, is incurable and generally causes death within 10 years of onset.

Victoria Anne Cotton,"July 15, 2006","Goleta, California",50,Caucasian / White,"5'5"" - 5'7""",145 lbs,"Cotton was last seen in the morning hours of July 15, 2006. She left her residence on foot in the vicinity of the 7400 block of San Carpino Avenue in Goleta, California and boarded a bus en route to the Farmer's Market in Santa Barbara, California.

Witness reports are conflicted as to where exactly Cotton was last seen, but it may have been in downtown Goleta at Nectarine and Hollister, where she stopped at a 7-11 store to get a paper. She has never been heard from again.

Cotton has gone missing in the past, but she always returned within a day. She was carrying very little money with her when she disappeared in July 2006 and her loved ones do not believe she left of her own accord.

Cotton has a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's degree in mechanical engineering and has previously worked in a laboratory; her speciality was advanced infrared science. She was unable to return to her work after her meningitis episode in 1986.

She does not drive; she walks or utilizes public transportation instead. Cotton frequents community centers, markets, libraries and colleges in the Goleta and Santa Barbara areas. Her case remains unsolved.

Cotton suffered from a near-fatal case of bacterial meningitis in 1986 and developed a brain abscess. She underwent several brain surgeries to correct the problem, but it left her disabled. She has significant problems with short-term memory as well as other cognitive issues, and she sometimes loses her balance while walking. Cotton's intelligence is not impaired and she is able to live independently, but she is considered to be at risk because of her condition.

She left behind her purse, wallet, wedding ring and keys. Leonard stated she had only $50 and a credit card with her when she vanished, and the credit card was never used.

Donella's family believes she did not leave voluntarily and they think Leonard killed her. He stated their argument was violent and she hit him with a rock. He admitted he struck his wife in the head with a vase, breaking it and causing her to bleed from her nose and ears, but he denies that he murdered her or knows her whereabouts.

Although the police considered him a suspect at the onset of the investigation, some evidence in the case was lost and Leonard has never been charged in Donella's case.

Leonard and Donella have a son who was two years old in 1979. She was working as an executive secretary at the time of her disappearance. Her mother died in 2012.

Ashani Karin Creighton,"March 21, 1997","Orlando, Florida",4,African American / Black,"4'0""",50 lbs,"Ashani was last seen on March 21, 1997 in their hometown of Orlando, Florida. She was initially abducted by her non-custodial grandparents, Ernest S. Jackson and Kaia Jackson, also known as Ernest and Abiola Anderson, in March 1997. Her mother had sent her to visit them and they refused to return her.

The Jacksons moved from Orlando to Tulsa, Oklahoma in August 1998, with their four children. The last confirmed sighting of Ashani took place at around that time.

Ashani's grandparents were arrested for child abuse charges in October 2000 in Oklahoma. The charges were about the abuse of their eight-year-old son in 1988 and are not related to Ashani's case.

The Jacksons were charged in 1988 after the child ran away from home and wandered into a Teaneck, New Jersey restaurant, disoriented and covered in burns and other injuries. He stated both of his parents beat him and at one point his mother refused to let him eat for fifteen days straight, then beat him with a belt after she caught him climbing out the window to take fruit from a tree. He had scars all over his body, including on his chest, his shoulders, his abdomen, his collarbone, his knees, and twenty to thirty on each hand.

His parents skipped bail and fled, and weren't caught until 2000. The Jacksons' children were located in Oklahoma when Ernest and Kaia were arrested, but Ashani was not with them at the time of their arrest and she has not been seen again.

Kaia was convicted on the charges and sentenced to thirty-five years in prison. Ernest's jury failed to reach a verdict at his first trial and he was acquitted the second time, but in 2002 he was convicted of aggravated assault and child endangerment involving another child in New Jersey in the 1980s and sentenced to twelve years in prison. He was released from prison in 2009.

Ashani's grandparents are the prime suspects in her disappearance. Investigators believe she was murdered in Florida in approximately 1999, and her body was taken to Oklahoma and buried in the Tulsa area.

The Jacksons have refused to be interviewed regarding Ashani's case and have never been charged in connection with it. Her case remains unsolved.

She has never been heard from again. She was separated from her husband, the father of her three teenage children, and living in an apartment in the 500 block of Allison Avenue at the time of her disappearance. She had moved in during the fall of 2016.

She remained on good terms with her husband. He reported her missing on March 30. He had been unable to get in touch with her since the middle of the month, but he waited to report her missing because she had left for brief periods before and then returned.

It's possible Crider went to the Newark, Ohio area after her disappearance. Due to her state of health, there is grave concern for her safety; she could die without medical treatment. Her loved ones stated she was not suicidal, but she had spoken about dying and told her husband to take care of their children if anything happened to her.

Although Crider was battling drug addiction at the time of her disappearance, her family doesn't believe she overdosed, and she has never gone for this long without contacting loved ones. Her disappearance remains unsolved.

Crider was in poor health at the time of her disappearance and was in need of a lung transplant. She used oxygen most of the time, but was sometimes able to go without it for short periods. She has a history of drug abuse, and she needs daily medication. All her oxygen and medications were left behind.

Susan Marie Powell,"December 7, 2009","West Valley City, UT",28,White,"5'4""",130 lbs,"A friend of Susan Powell visited her at her residence in the 6200 block of west Sarah Circle in West Valley City, Utah on December 6, 2009. According to her friend, Susan was behaving normally at the time and only said she was tired and wanted to nap before dinner.

The next day, both Susan and Josh didn't show up for work or call their employers to say they would be absent, and they also failed to drop their children off at day care. Authorities issued a missing persons bulletin for Susan, Josh and their two sons, two-year-old Charlie and four-year-old Braden.

Josh and the children returned home at 5:00 p.m., but Susan has never been heard from again. Josh said he had taken his sons camping in the desert at Simpson Springs, along the Pony Express Trail, late on Sunday night. He returned home to find Susan missing.

He said he last saw Susan at their home at 12:30 a.m. on December 7, as he was setting out on the camping trip. Susan didn't go with them because she felt sick. Josh said he didn't go to work on Monday because he got confused about what day of the week it was.

Authorities quickly classified Susan's disappearance as suspicious and executed a search warrant on her home. Her family described her as a devoted mother who would not have abandoned her children, and she left her purse, keys and cellular phone behind at home.

In January 2010, a month after Susan's disappearance, Josh packed his family's belongings, put their house up for rent and moved Puyallup, Washington with the children. Both he and Susan are originally from Washington and have relatives there.

Some of Susan's neighbors stated she had been unhappy in her marriage and had spoken openly of divorce; one of her acquaintances stated Susan had been saving money for this purpose. The couple met in 2000 and married in 2001 after six months of dating.

They had initially been happy together, but their relationship deteriorated after they moved from Washington state to Utah several years before Susan's disappearance. They filed for bankruptcy in 2007. Susan reportedly described Josh as controlling and claimed they argued frequently. She was active in her local ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), but Josh had stopped attending church services.

Susan had reportedly said she planned to leave Josh on April 6, 2010, the couple's wedding anniversary, if their marriage didn't improve before then.

There was speculation that Susan's disappearance was connected to the December 2009 disappearance of 30-year-old Steven Koecher. He left his St. George, Utah home on December 12 and was last seen the next day in Nevada. Authorities could find no connection between the disappearances and no evidence that the two knew each other, however.

In late March 2012, newly unsealed documents revealed additional evidence police had that tied Josh to Susan's disappearance. Her blood had been found on the tile floor next to the couch in the family home and her cellular phone was in Josh's car, something he couldn't explain.

When Josh turned Susan's phone over to the police, it was turned off and missing its SIM card. He later gave his own phone over to authorities and it too was missing the SIM card.

Susan had $1.5 million in insurance on her life. A short time after her disappearance, Josh began drawing on her retirement account, and he canceled all her upcoming chiropractic appointments.

Susan left a will in a safe deposit box registered in her name only, along with a handwritten letter addressed to her family and friends, saying Josh had threatened to ""destroy"" her and told her the children ""will not have a mother and father"" if she divorced him. The letter stated if she died, it ""may not be an accident, even if it looks like one.""

Before her disappearance, Susan worked as a stockbroker for the Wells Fargo Bank. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.","https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/4890

She lived with her boyfriend, Robert Brent Butcher Jr. Janis remained close friends with her former husband, Michael Stavros, who also resided in the area.

She, Butcher and her daughter, Meghan Laudie, had dinner at Michael's home during the evening hours of January 2, 2001. Michael and Laudie said that Janis and Butcher departed at approximately 10:00 p.m. Janis has never been heard from again.

Butcher said that he departed from their home at approximately 6:00 a.m. on January 3 for his shift at a construction site. He claimed that Janis was asleep when he left their residence. Laudie attempted to call her mother during the afternoon hours, but Butcher told her that Janis was not at home.

Laudie and Michael reported her as a missing person on January 4, two days after Janis disappeared. Authorities searched her residence and discovered that all of Janis's personal belongings were inside, including her cellular phone. Her new puppy was also inside the house and Janis's pickup truck was parked outside.

Investigators obtained a search warrant for the property and discovered a canister with marijuana residue, as well as several guns and knives. Blood and bloodstains were found on several unspecified items in the home. Cleaning products had also been placed inside Janis's vehicle.

Butcher, who has a criminal record, was jailed due to a parole violation on January 9, 2001, a week after Janis vanished. He has maintained his innocence in Janis's case and he has never been charged in connection with her disappearance. Laudie told authorities that Janis mentioned she and Butcher were having problems in their relationship in January 2001.

There has not been any activity on Janis's bank accounts or credit cards since her disappearance. Her loved ones said it is extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning and she did not have any travel plans. She is considered to be missing under suspicious circumstances.

She had recently moved to Utah and was living with various friends, moving from house to house. At the time of her disappearance, she lived with friends in an abandoned RV camper with no electricity, about five miles north of town.

According to two witnesses, the last time anyone saw Westreicher, she got into an argument with another woman about the woman's boyfriend. The woman's boyfriend said he was annoyed by the argument and choked Westreicher, and when he let her go she left the camper angrily with the dog. She has never been heard from again. Her ex-boyfriend reported her missing in August.

The night she left was cold and she was not dressed suitably for the freezing temperatures. She left her cellular phone and backpack behind in the camper, which is uncharacteristic of her behavior; she kept all her belongings in that backpack.

Westreicher is originally from California. Two persons of interest have been identified in her case, and were questioned by police, but neither has been charged in her case or named publicly.

Williams was reported missing in May 2002. For a long time authorities believed she had vanished on March 6, 2002, but later information indicated she could have disappeared as early as November 2001.

She left behind a young son. She was involved with drugs at the time of her disappearance and has a criminal history with felony convictions for drug offenses and stolen property, and it wasn't uncommon for her to drop out of sight for short time periods, but she's never been out of touch with her family for this long before.

In 2014, authorities reopened Williams's case and conducted searches of several locations, including the Jordan River and another body of water. They stated some people had come recently come forward with new information and they believe Williams was murdered.

In March 2014, Ricky Lee Vincent was charged with felony obstruction of justice in connection with her case. Authorities stated they didn't believe he was actually involved in Williams's disappearance, but he was a known acquaintance of their suspect.

The suspect has not been publicly identified in the press. In a television interview, Vincent said the man is his brother, but police would not confirm this. No further arrests have been made.

Robin Roxanne Hughes,"July 5, 2017","Bowling Green, Kentucky",58,Caucasian / White,"5'4"" - 5'6""",130 lbs - 150 lbs,"Hughes was last seen in Bowling Green, Kentucky in early July 2017. Her own car was in the shop for repairs, and she borrowed her mother's car that day. Two men were with her when she picked it up.

Over the next few days, Hughes's mother tried to call her several times. On July 8, Hughes returned her call and said she would return the car as soon as possible. She also said she was trying to get her boyfriend, Ismael Beltran, to leave her house, but couldn't talk about it. Just after midnight on July 9, Hughes's mother heard a car in her driveway. She looked out the window and saw that her car had been returned.

On the afternoon of July 11, Hughes's father and her adult son went to her home to check on her, as her parents hadn't been able to get in touch with her. All the lights were off, but the television was on. Hughes's keys were in the living room and her dogs had been left alone, which is uncharacteristic of her. Her bedroom door was locked from the inside, but her father and her son were able to force it open. There were no indications of a struggle.

There has been no indication of Hughes's whereabouts since then, and Beltran has not been seen since July 8. The last person to see him was his ex-wife; he told her he needed to get out of town because he had no work.

Hughes has never gone missing before. The circumstances of her and Beltran's disappearances are unclear.

Angela Christine Mack,"September 1, 2002","Salem, AR",20,White,"5'3""",100 lbs,"Angela Mack was last seen in Salem, Arkansas on September 1, 2002. She disappeared along with her son, Thomas Rettew, riding a late model dark gray or blue Chevrolet or GMC extended cab pickup truck with Missouri license plates. Neither of them have been heard from again.

Angela was married at the time of her disappearance, but she was in a relationship with another man, Matthew Niederbach. They have one son together, who was left behind when Angela and Thomas disappeared. Both Angela's husband and Niederbach live in Salem. Thomas is Angela's son by a previous relationship; his biological father died in Idaho in 2019.

For unclear reasons, Angela's disappearance was not reported until August 2004, nearly two years after she and Thomas disappeared. There were reports that she was going to California and/or Iowa. Investigators believe the man Angela was involved with have vital information in her case. There are rumors that she was murdered and buried on top of a fresh grave in the Salem area, and that her son was trafficked or was murdered along with her.

Angela and Thomas disappeared from Alton, Missouri, which is forty miles northeast of Salem. They are considered missing under suspicious circumstances.

Kathleen Durst,"January 31, 1982","Manhattan, NY / Connecticut / South Salem, NY",29,White,"5'5""",120 lbs,"Kathleen was last seen by friends at a dinner party in Connecticut on January 31, 1982. She arrived unexpectedly at the home of Gilberte Najamy, who was her closest friend at the time. Najamy stated Kathleen was visibly upset and that she was wearing sweatpants; she normally wore dressier clothing.

Kathleen had received a phone call from her husband, former real estate heir Robert Alan Durst, at approximately 7:00 p.m. and they apparently had an argument. She had spoken about her failing marriage during the course of the evening with Najamy. She told Najamy that she was returning to the couple's cottage on Hoyt Street in South Salem, New York.

Najamy stated that Kathleen also asked her to investigate in case anything happened to her. She was afraid that her husband would harm her.

Robert told authorities he drove Kathleen to the Katonah station to catch the 9:15 p.m. train to the New York City borough of Manhattan later that same evening. The couple owned two apartments in Manhattan at the time. He said they had argued and Kathleen had drunk an entire bottle of wine. If Kathleen did catch the 9:15 train, she would have had only forty minutes in between to consume the wine.

Robert also claimed that he never saw his wife again, but he did speak to her over the phone after she supposedly arrived in Manhattan at approximately 11:00 p.m. Robert stated that the couple often lived apart and this arrangement was not unusual for their lifestyles.

Robert's version of events changed when speaking with law enforcement officials shortly after his initial statement. He told investigators that he actually called Kathleen from a pay phone near their South Salem cottage while walking their dog that evening. The nearest phone is three miles away on a dirt road and a snowstorm hit the area that night.

Robert also claimed that he stopped at a neighbor's home for a drink afterwards. The residents said they never saw him that evening, but they did observe a blue light shining through the basement windows of the Dursts' cottage the following night.

Najamy became concerned when Kathleen failed to meet her at The Lion's Gate in downtown New York City shortly after her disappearance. Najamy called authorities for several days in a row after she was unable to locate Kathleen.

Robert filed a missing person's report on February 5. He claimed that he did not know Kathleen was missing until one of the deans from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the borough of the Bronx called him to report that Kathleen had not attended classes all week. She was enrolled at the school and only had three more months before graduation.

The dean stated that a woman identifying herself as Kathleen called the college on February 1 and said she was sick and could not attend class. No one is certain of the caller's true identity.

A doorman at the Dursts' Manhattan apartment on Riverside Drive claimed he saw Kathleen at the residence on February 1, one day after her last confirmed sighting. The doorman later admitted that he only saw the woman from behind and could not positively identify the person.

The building's superintendent claimed that Robert threw out the majority of Kathleen's belongings shortly after she vanished. Robert also began searching for a new tenant for the couple's apartment. Robert denied the allegations.

Najamy broke into the South Salem cottage with her sister during the week Kathleen vanished. She called authorities from the home and told them that she entered the residence illegally, then requested an officer arrive at the scene. Investigators refused to dispatch anyone to the location.

Najamy and her sister discovered Kathleen's unopened mail was tossed into the garbage. Robert told Najamy that Kathleen was wearing brown suede boots and a cable-knit sweater when he dropped her off at the train station, but Najamy found the clothing inside Kathleen's closet. She and her sister also discovered trash bags stuffed into a floor-to-ceiling closet in the cottage's dining room. She said that they became frightened afterwards and left the residence.

Kathleen was a former dental hygienist and nurse. She and Robert met in 1970 while she was living in an apartment building owned by Robert's family. They were married in 1972 and moved to Vermont, where they owned a health food store called All the Good Things.

Kathleen graduated from the nursing program at Western Connecticut State University in 1978, then enrolled in the Einstein College Of Medicine. She wanted to become a pediatrician.

Kathleen's friends told investigators that she wanted to have children, but Robert did not. They also claimed that Robert pressured Kathleen into having an abortion in the late 1970s. Robert was having an affair with Prudence Farrow, a producer and the sister of the actress Mia Farrow, when Kathleen disappeared.

According to her friends and family, Kathleen decided to prepare the paperwork necessary for a divorce. Najamy stated that she believed Robert felt he was losing control of Kathleen at the time, since she was about to graduate from medical school and was able to support herself. He also claimed that she had affairs as well and that he did not believe the child she aborted was his baby.

Kathleen's loved ones said that she was treated at an emergency room in New York City in January 1982 after Robert allegedly abused her. Kathleen suffered head injuries and facial bruising, but refused to file charges against her husband. The incident occurred several weeks before she vanished.

Investigators discovered that Robert had placed several phone calls to the Durst Organization from Ship Bottom, New Jersey the week Kathleen disappeared. Some have speculated that Robert may have disposed of his wife's remains near the city.

Najamy drove to the Dursts' cottage once a week to search through the trash and found some of Kathleen's belongings had been discarded, along with several of Robert's handwritten notes. Authorities asked Najamy not to discuss what was written on the notes, but she insinuated that it may have involved Kathleen's case. Authorities did not conduct a thorough search of the Dursts' South Salem cottage during the 1982 investigation into Kathleen's disappearance.

Detectives initially believed that Kathleen had simply disappeared in order to escape a bad marriage and no foul play was involved. That manner of thinking changed as the years progressed with no sign of Kathleen.

In 1999, an informant announced that Kathleen was killed on the night of her disappearance in South Salem, the location of the couple's cottage. An extensive search of the property was launched at that time and evidence was removed from the house. Authorities have not publicly announced their findings. Robert sold the cottage in 1990.

Najamy's home and the home of another of Kathleen's friends were broken into and ransacked sometime after Kathleen's disappearance. The two women had kept files relating to Kathleen's case and the files were among the items stolen from their residences. The burglaries remain unsolved and the stolen items were never recovered.

Another strange twist in Kathleen's disappearance emerged in December 2000, when author Susan Berman was murdered by a .22 caliber gunshot to the back of the head in Los Angeles, California. Berman had been a friend of both Kathleen and Robert in New York and the three frequently socialized together.

Berman and Robert remained close friends throughout the years and she served as his unofficial public spokesperson during the 1982 investigation into Kathleen's case.

Some people believe that Berman, who was protective of Robert, may have placed the phone call to the medical school dean and disguised herself as Kathleen in 1982. The suggestion has also been raised that Berman was murdered by organized crime figures as a result of her family connections, but investigators believed the possibility was remote.

Investigators are probing into the possibility that Robert may have been involved in Kathleen's case. He has always maintained his innocence.

Kathleen was declared legally deceased in December 2001. Robert agreed to split her $130,000 estate with her mother. A judge ordered that Robert's share of the estate be held in escrow in New York City until the outcome of the criminal investigation into Kathleen's disappearance was closed. The ruling does not affect law enforcement's continuing effort to resolve her case.

Robert was charged with the murder of Morris Black in October 2001. His dismembered remains, all but the head, were discovered in late September 2001. He lived in the same apartment complex as Robert in Galveston, Texas.

Several of Berman's friends claimed she told them Robert confessed to Kathleen's murder. The reports began to surface in January 2002. Berman allegedly told a friend that she had vital information related to Kathleen's disappearance in December 2000; Berman was killed five days later.

Robert failed to appear at a Texas court hearing for Black's murder on October 17, 2001 and proceeded to evade authorities for nearly seven weeks until his capture in Pennsylvania on November 30, 2001.

Robert was acquitted of murdering Black in November 2003. Jurors cited a lack of evidence as the reason for their verdict. He pleaded guilty to two counts of bail-jumping and one count of abuse of a corpse after his acquittal. He was sentenced to five years in prison but was released after only two weeks.

Robert was arrested again in October 2004 for gun charges and was sentenced to nine months in prison but was paroled in July 2005. His lawyer states that he is innocent of any wrongdoing in his wife's case and was so devastated by her disappearance that he still carries a photograph of her with him at all times.

Authorities have looked into the possibility that Robert was in the Eureka, California area in November 1997. Karen Mitchell disappeared during that time and her case remains unsolved. Robert has never been charged in connection with Mitchell's case and investigators are not certain if he was in the vicinity at the time.

Investigators don't believe he was involved in the case of Kristen Modafferi, who disappeared from San Francisco, California that same year, but he's being looked at in the 1971 disappearance of Lynne Schulze from Middlebury, Vermont. Robert and Kathleen owned their health food store in Middlebury at the time of Schulze's disappearance, and she visited the store the day she disappeared.

HBO ran a six-part documentary called The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst in early 2015. For the documentary they interviewed Robert extensively.

In the final part, after an interview, Robert took a bathroom break, not realizing the microphone he was wearing was still turned on. He began talking to himself and said, ""What a disaster,"" and ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""

Shortly after the documentary aired, Robert was charged with murder in the death of Susan Berman. He was living in New Orleans under an alias at the time of his arrest, and authorities found a gun, a mask and $43,000 in cash in his hotel room. They had feared he might try to flee the country. After his arrest he was transferred to a mental health facility and put on suicide watch.

Kathleen's case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected. Robert is awaiting trial for Berman's murder.",https://charleyproject.org/case/kathleen-durst,-73.5526381,41.2857034
Lourdes Maria Gruart,"October 14, 2000","New York, NY",46,Latina (Cuban),"5'10""",130 lbs,"Lourdes Gruart and her family immigrated to the United States from Cuba when she was a child. She graduated from the University Of Florida at Tampa with a major in international affairs.

Lourdes began modeling and performing with local ballet troupes during her college years. She moved to New York City after she completed college and attempted to begin her modeling career in earnest while working as a hostess in restaurants.

Lourdes relocated to Milan, Italy in 1983. She found success as a European runway model during the following years. She returned to the United States in 1988.

Lourdes spent the winters at her parents' residence in Florida in the early 1990s and continued to search for print work as a model, but was greeted with little success.

Lourdes's friends said that she became concerned about her personal life by 1994 and that she became increasingly paranoid by 1998. Many of other friends believed that the end of Lourdes's modeling career served as the catalyst for her depression.

Lourdes was eventually employed at Winston Staffing, a modeling agency in New York City, in the late 1990s.

Lourdes resided in an apartment in the 400 block of east 83rd Street in the borough of Manhattan in 2000. She allowed her younger brother, Mario Gruart, to stay with her while he was unemployed during the year.

Lourdes's friends are divided on her impressions of her brother; some stated that she adored him, while others claimed that she was wary of Mario's intentions. She had bailed him out financially several times and shortly before her disappearance, she asked him to move out of her home and they argued.

Mario told authorities that Lourdes announced she was traveling to Europe on October 14, 2000. He claimed that she left her residence carrying a large green bag and departed in a waiting car at approximately 8:00 a.m.

Lourdes has never been heard from again. She left all of her personal belongings behind, but her lingerie has never been discovered. Lourdes and Mario's mother said that her daughter never traveled without alerting her to her plans.

Mario moved most of Lourdes's possessions out of sight in her apartment after her disappearance and replaced her belongings with his own items. He claimed that Lourdes said she would be returning to New York City in several weeks, but authorities learned that Lourdes's passport expired in 1988.

Investigators began to doubt Mario's story and searched Lourdes's apartment. Mario admitted that he disposed of her couch shortly after she vanished, but said that he and Lourdes had agreed on the decision and new furniture would be arriving shortly.

Authorities said that the couch has never been replaced and traced the item to a refuse yard in New Jersey. Investigators were never able to locate the item, but they do not believe it contains evidence relating to Lourdes's case.

Authorities viewed Mario as a possible suspect for several months after Lourdes's disappearance but have since stated they do not believe he was involved in her case. Investigators are unsure if Lourdes vanished of her own accord, committed suicide or was the victim of foul play.

There were rumors circulating around the time Lourdes disappeared that claimed she was involved in prostitution as a means of additional income. Some people speculated that could explain why her lingerie was missing from her residence, as she may have operated from a different location.

The theories have never been confirmed, however. Lourdes's friends' opinions remain divided on her whereabouts and her case remains unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/lourdes-maria-gruart,-73.950331,40.7747547
Gail Beth Katz-Bierenbaum,"July 7, 1985","Manhattan, NY",29,White,"5'2""-5'3""",110 lbs,"Gail was last seen at the apartment she shared with her husband, Dr. Robert ""Bob"" Bierenbaum, in the New York City borough of Manhattan at 11:00 .m. July 7, 1985. Robert claimed he and Gail argued that morning and Gail walked out of the residence on east 85th Street to go sunbathe in Central Park.

Robert later said he waited in the apartment until 5:30 p.m., then went to a family birthday party in New Jersey. He didn't appear concerned at the party, but while at a friend's house that evening, he acted upset and called his apartment a few times.

At midnight, Robert called one of Gail's friends to ask if she knew his wife's whereabouts. The next day, he called her psychotherapist (Gail missed her regularly scheduled appointment that day) and other people to ask if they had seen her. When Robert her missing to the authorities on the evening of July 8, he stated their marriage was deeply troubled and both of them were in therapy.

Gail has never been heard from again. The last time anyone besides her husband saw her was on July 6. That day she saw her gynecologist and her hairdresser and spent some time with a friend in the afternoon hours.

Early on in the investigation, police asked for permission to search the couple's apartment. Robert said he'd get back to them about that, but he never did. In September, he finally gave permission for investigators to come to the apartment, but only to search for fingerprints and anything else that might identify Gail. When a police officer conducted the search on September 30, he looked around for evidence of a crime but didn't see anything of interest.

Gail's family denied Robert's statements about Gail's alleged mental illness and substance abuse to investigators and said that Gail told them he had been mentally and physically abusing her for some time prior to her disappearance.Robert's attorney denied the Katz family's statements during the initial 1985 investigation.

Investigators determined that Robert, a licensed pilot, took a two-hour flight in a rented four-passenger Cessna 172 Skyhawk from Essex County, New Jersey over the Atlantic Ocean the day Gail vanished. Robert failed to mention this fact to authorities during their initial questioning of him, although at their request he had provided a timeline of his and Gail's activities in the days immediately prior to her disappearance. A 1986 search of the plane and two vehicles Robert drove at the time of Gail's disappearance yielded nothing of interest.

Gail and Robert had been married since 1982 and had had a stormy relationship for some time. She had left him for a time in the fall of 1983, but the couple reconciled. Gail had an affair with an investment banker during the summer of 1984 and the spring of 1985, and by the time of her disappearance she'd become romantically involved with a coworker.

Gail was working on a doctorate in clinical psychology from Long Island University at the time she vanished, while Robert was on-staff as a physician at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. She told friends that she was planning to divorce Robert. She had taken out a $10,000 loan so she could pay for graduate school without his help, and for months prior to her disappearance she had been looking for another place to live.

Investigators believed that Robert was involved in Gail's disappearance for many years and was responsible for her presumed death but lacked evidence to make an arrest in the case.

Robert moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1989 and set up a medical practice in the city. This was the same year that a partial female body washed ashore in Staten Island, New York. DNA tests were not available at the time, but authorities believed that the remains were Gail's after conducting x-ray exams on the corpse. The body was buried and it was assumed that Gail had been located, but the case remained unsolved.

Robert married another doctor and the couple had a child together in the 1990s. Robert and his family moved to North Dakota, where both he and his wife practiced medicine. DNA testing became available in 1997 and the body believed to be Gail's was re-examined at her family's request. Forensic results proved that the body was not Gail's and her case was officially reopened by New York authorities.

Robert was arrested with second-degree murder in Gail's case in 2000 in North Dakota after ample evidence was compiled to prove a case against him. He was then extradited to New York to face trial.

Authorities believe that Robert strangled Gail in their Manhattan apartment on July 7, 1985 and then dismembered her body, placed her in a duffel bag and tossed it into the ocean during his plane flight. At his 2000 trial, eleven witnesses testified that Gail had told them Robert abused her and she was afraid of his temper.

Robert denied all the allegations against him, although his defense attorney did concede that Gail was probably dead. He was convicted of Gail's murder in October 2000 and sentenced to twenty years to life in prison. Gail has never been located, but she is presumed deceased due to the circumstances involved in her case.",https://charleyproject.org/case/gail-beth-katz-bierenbaum,-73.9544916,40.7781416

Indira Montiero,"April 2, 2000","Manhattan, NY",22,Latina,"5'4""",110 lbs,"Indira Montiero was last seen at her apartment in the 1800 block of 7th Avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan on April 2, 2000. At approximately 7:00 p.m. the night before, she was speaking on the phone with a friend when her live-in boyfriend, Heriberto ""Eddie"" Palacio, was overheard screaming and swearing at her in the background.

Montiero has never been heard from again. Her boyfriend said he last saw her on April 2 when she went to a hairdresser's appointment, but the police found out she never visited a hairdresser that day. In fact, no one besides Palacio claims to have seen Montiero after April 1.

He never reported her missing; her brother did, on April 7. Palacio said he didn't approach the police about her disappearance because she had an order of protection against him and he feared he would be arrested.

Montiero left her clothes and beeper behind in her apartment. On April 2, the same day Palacio claims he last saw her, Montiero's wallet, identification and credit cards were found at a pay phone at a Mobil gas station next to the Grand Central Parkway near LaGuardia Airport, opposite the Delta Airlines terminal.

The gas station attendant who found the wallet didn't report his discovery for several days because he assumed the owner would return for it. Authorities believe whoever placed the wallet at the gas station did so in an attempt to mislead the investigation.

Montiero's relationship with Palacio had always been troubled. She reportedly loved Palacio deeply, but in the two years that they were together she filed eleven domestic violence complaints against him and he filed four such complaints against her.

Kacie Aleece Peterson,"September 21, 2013","Manhattan, NY",22,White,"5'9""-5'10""",145-155 lbs,"Kacie Peterson was last seen on Baruch Drive in the New York City borough of Manhattan on September 21, 2013. She was attending the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the time of her disappearance.

Peterson is originally from Colville, Washington. She has gone missing before; on October 1, 2009, at the age of eighteen, she withdrew $400 from her bank account and vanished from her home in Washington before resurfacing in New York City later that month. She wasn't identified for two weeks, as she had left all her identification and belongings behind and was suffering from memory lost and had left all her other belongings behind.

Peterson's father stated she had had memory lapses before her 2009 disappearance and that their relationship was ""difficult"", although he said she had no history of mental illness or drug abuse.

After her 2013 disappearance, however, Peterson was never heard from again. She has a New York driver's license and may be in the southern United States. Her case remains unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/kacie-aleece-peterson,-73.9777081,40.7182505
Juliet Stuart Poyntz,"June 1, 1937","Manhattan, NY",50,White,,,"Juliet Poyntz was last seen in the New York City borough of Manhattan sometime during June 1937, possibly June 4 or 5. She left her room in the American WomanÕs Association Clubhouse in the 300 block of west 57th Street and vanished. She was not reported missing until December of that year.

Poyntz left behind all her personal belongings, including her clothing, luggage, passport, unfinished manuscripts, and a savings account containing $10,500 which has not been touched since her disappearance. Authorities judged from the appearance of her room that she planned to return within a short time.

Poyntz is a former history professor at Barnard College and was one of the founding members of the American Communist Party, which came into existence between 1919 and 1921. She was listed in the New York Police Department files as one of the top ten principal Communist leaders in the United States. She ran for public office several times as Communist candidate but was never elected.

Poyntz dropped out of the Communist Party in 1934 to work for the OGPU, the Russian secret police and predecessor to the KGB. She was assigned to gather information about chemistry and physics from the United States.

She traveled to Moscow, Russia in 1936 for additional instructions but became disillusioned with Joseph Stalin's regime and was unwilling to spy for the OGPU anymore. She told friends she planned write her memoirs and expose the Communist Party.

It is believed that Poyntz was murdered by the OGPU to silence her. Several people confessed to killing her after her disappearance, but no one was ever charged. She was declared legally dead in October 1944 and her estate was given to her sister, her sole surviving relative.",https://charleyproject.org/case/juliet-stuart-poyntz,-73.9836191,40.7670338
Irene Silverman,"July 5, 1998","Manhattan, NY",82,White,"5'0""",115 lbs,"Silverman was last seen at her townhouse on east 65th Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan on July 5, 1998. She was a wealthy former ballerina who often rented out apartments in her mansion to business people.

Silverman has never been heard from again. Her disappearance brought to light a myriad of bizarre events that ultimately led to two convictions for her presumed murder.

Kenneth Kimes was a tenant in Silverman's mansion at the time she vanished. He moved into one of her apartments in June 1998, one month before she was last seen. Kenneth used the alias of Manny Guerrin.

Authorities believed that Kenneth and his mother, Sante Kimes, were actually con artists who monitored Silverman's business activities for months before Kenneth moved into her home.

Authorities arrested the mother and son on the day of Silverman's disappearance. The initial charges stemmed from a fraudulent check written in Utah for $14,900 for the purchase of a Lincoln Town Car earlier in 1998; they were charged with Silverman's murder in December 1998.

Authorities believed Sante and Kenneth devised a scheme to steal Silverman's mansion, which was valued at between seven and ten million dollars.

Authorities believed that Kenneth and Sante smothered Silverman, somehow smuggled her body out of her house during the day, then drove her remains to an unknown burial location in their Lincoln Town Car.

The Kimeses' trial brought out many colorful stories about other possible motives and suspects from their defense attorneys.

Sante and Kenneth were convicted of Silverman's murder in May 2000. She was sentenced to 120 years in prison; he was given 125 years behind bars.

Authorities have always maintained that Sante planned Silverman's murder and Kenneth acted as the physical force. Kenneth confessed to killing Silverman in November 2000.

Kenneth said that he wrapped Silverman's body in black plastic garbage bags and dumped her remains in a ditch at a construction site in New Jersey, 35 to 40 minutes from the Holland Tunnel. He claimed he did not remember the exact location of her burial site.

Authorities were conducting searches with Kenneth's input until his extradition to California; the search for Silverman has since been postponed. Kenneth continues to maintain that his mother was not involved in Silverman's murder. She died in prison in 2014.

Sante and Kenneth were also considered possible suspects in disappearance of Mary ""Jacqueline"" Levitz, an heiress to a multi-million dollar estate who disappeared from Mississippi in 1995. Levitz vanished from her home and is presumed murdered, but her body has never been recovered.

While there are similarities between her case and Silverman's disappearance, no link between the two cases has been established.","https://charleyproject.org/case/irene-silverman

Tiffany saw him to the door and began the three- to four-block walk P.S. Junior High School 142 on Henry Street for her own seventh-grade classes. She was last seen near the school at 8:00 a.m. She never arrived at class that day and has not been heard from again.

Tiffany resided with her aunt, Norma Delgado, on Hart Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn at the time of her disappearance.

Stanina Ignjatovic,"April 15, 1999","Brooklyn, NY",54,White,"4'9""",135 lbs,"Ignjatovic was last heard from on the morning of April 15, 1999 when she called a relative from her apartment on Conselyea Street in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and said she was going to the borough of Manhattan to visit her sister. She never arrived and has never been heard from again. No signs of a struggle or forced entry were found at her apartment, and there was no note.

Ignjatovic had been having problems with her landlord, Marion Okuniewski, at the time of her disappearance. In 1997, an electrical fire badly damaged her apartment building and forced the tenants to move elsewhere. Ignjatovic sought help from a tenant advocacy organization, the St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Organization, saying Okuniewski was not making repairs fast enough.

A tenant advocate accompanied her to Housing Court to ensure that Ignjatovic would be able to move back into her rent-controlled apartment once it was repaired. Both Ignjatovic and the tenant advocate claim Okuniewski threatened them; the advocate says Okuniewski said he would burn her house down. On the morning of March 13, 1998, someone did set fire to some benzine-soaked rags at the entrance to the advocate's building. The arson remains unsolved.

The following month, the Housing Court ordered Okuniewski to provide Ignjatovic with accommodation in a building he owned near the one that was burned, and to repair Ignjatovic's old apartment in time to let her move back in by April 3, 1999.

After Ignjatovic moved into the temporary apartment, it was burglarized and ransacked three times. On January 31 and March 10, the burglar(s) slashed Ignjatovic's clothes and furniture and stole court documents relating to the housing case. The burglaries remain unsolved.

When Ignjatovic was supposed to move back in to her old apartment, Okuniewski said he would only allow her to do so if she agreed to a 40% rent increase. In response, Ignjatovic's attorney asked the Housing Court to cite Okuniewski for contempt. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for April 20, but Ignjatovic disappeared on April 15.

Okuniewski denies having threatened or bothered Ignjatovic and stated she paid her rent on time and he had no personal issues with her.

It is unclear whether the housing dispute had anything to do with Ignjatovic's disappearance. She is considered to be missing under unclear circumstances.",https://charleyproject.org/case/stanina-ignjatovic,-73.944688,40.715222

Kristine Kupka,"October 24, 1998","Brooklyn, NY",28,White,"5'8""",140 lbs,"Kupka was last seen leaving her home in the 200 block of Westminister Avenue in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on October 24, 1998 at approximately 12:30 p.m. Her roommate said that Kupka's boyfriend, Darshanand ""Rudy"" Persaud, arrived at their house shortly beforehand. Persaud seemed nervous, according to her roommate.

Kupka was five months pregnant with his child at the time of her disappearance. She left a message on her sister's answering machine before she and Persaud left, saying that she was going to view his new apartment in the borough of Queens and would return home shortly. Kupka has never been heard from again. She did not have a coat, any personal belongings or very much money on her when she disappeared.

Persaud and Kupka had a troubled relationship. He was her adjunct chemistry instructor at Baruch College in New York City, where she majored in philosophy. They began dating shortly after she completed his class and continued their relationship for five months.

Kupka became pregnant unexpectedly and told friends Persaud was not supportive of the pregnancy and had begged her to have an abortion. Her loved ones stated that she seemed frightened he would hurt her or their child, although she never stated he had threatened her.

As it turned out, Persaud was married and reportedly only told Kupka of his marital status after she learned about her pregnancy. (He was not married at the time the infant was conceived.) He initially denied that he could be the baby's father, claiming he had had a ""partial vasectomy,"" but eventually backed down from that assertion.

According to Kupka's family and friends, Persaud was angry and scared, telling Kupka his family would disown him if she carried their baby to term. He is a Guyanese immigrant and his father is a Hindu priest.

Kupka was looking forward to becoming a single mother and is described as an intelligent and strong-willed person. She had a 3.97 grade point average at Baruch College, founded the school's Philosophy Club, and planned to attend law school and become a civil rights attorney, focusing on women's issues.

Kupka supported herself by working as a server at a Jamaican restaurant in 1998, and lived frugally with five roommates. She had $7,000 in her savings account. She was due to graduate from Baruch College in January 1999. She missed her midterm examinations after her disappearance, as well as appointments with her midwife.

Kupka allegedly spoke to Persaud's wife via telephone several times before she disappeared. According to her loved ones, Kupka said that she reached his wife after attempting to page Persaud. Kupka told his wife she did not want to disrupt the family, but she wanted Persaud to be a part of their child's life and said that she worried about the baby's emotional well-being if it did not have a relationship with both parents.

According to Kupka, Persaud's wife became angry at him after learning about Kupka's pregnancy. Kupka intended to name Persaud as the father on their child's birth certificate. She also planned to ask him for financial support for the baby if it became necessary.

Persaud and Kupka's relationship cooled for a time, but he resurfaced in Kupka's life shortly before her October 1998 disappearance. Kupka told friends he appeared on her doorstep and claimed his wife had thrown him out of the house and he was staying with a cousin.

It is not clear whether Kupka believed Persaud's story, but she told her family that she encouraged him to reconcile with his wife. Persaud apparently became more supportive of the pregnancy at the time, suggesting names for the baby and offering to be the birthing coach, which confused Kupka given his earlier attitude.

The reason behind Persaud's visit to Kupka's house on October 24 is not clear. Her loved ones stated that Kupka believed she was going to view his new apartment, while Persaud maintained that he was driving her to a nearby shopping mall.

Kupka's family was alerted to her disappearance by her roommate, who became concerned Kupka failed to return to her residence that evening. Kupka's family located Persaud's home and confronted him about Kupka's whereabouts. Persaud's mother alerted her son to the family's arrival and the police were called to prevent an altercation in case an incident arose.

Persaud told the family members that he drove Kupka to a shopping center, then waited in his car for her to return from shopping. Persaud claimed that he dropped Kupka off two blocks from her home between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m., as she wanted to walk to a nearby health food store. When Kupka's family asked him which shopping mall he had taken her to, he said he did not know and he had stayed in the car while she shopped.

Kupka's loved ones then questioned people in the neighborhood. A laundromat owner said he thought he had seen her walking past the establishment, and the proprietor of an area health food store said she might have seen her at approximately 7:00 p.m. the day of her disappearance. Later the health food store owner changed her mind and decided the woman she saw was not Kupka, since the woman was wearing peach-colored pants, which Kupka did not own.

Authorities have questioned Persaud just once, shortly after Kupka's disappearance. He hired an attorney a few days later and has not granted any further interviews. The Kupka family has since employed a private investigator and continues to publicize her case. The investigator has stated publicly that he believes Persaud was involved in her disappearance.

Persaud has never been charged in connection with Kupka's case and he maintains his innocence. Authorities have said that he was cooperative during his single interview, but have also mentioned that he did not have an alibi for the time Kupka vanished and they felt he was evasive at times during the questioning.

Detectives have stated that there is little in the way of physical evidence to prove what happened to Kupka and nothing linking Persaud to her disappearance beyond motive, but they believe she was the victim of a homicide.

In 2010, police began digging up the basement floor of a shop once owned by one of Persaud's relatives. One section of the concrete was not like the others, and a cadaver-sniffing dog indicated the presence of human remains. Nothing was found in the search, however.

Irina Malezhik,"October 15, 2007","Brooklyn, NY",47,White (Ukrainian),"5'2""",110 lbs,"Malezhik was last seen walking out the lobby of her apartment building the 400 block of Corbin Place in the New York City borough of Brooklyn at 1:00 p.m. on October 15, 2007. She has never been heard from again. A friend reported her missing on November 8. She left all her belongings and identification behind at home.

The day after Malezhik's disappearance, four checks signed with her name were deposited in the joint bank account of Dmitriy and Julia Yakovlev. Authorities later determined Malezhik's signature had been forged. The Yakovlevs allegedly got a credit card in Malezhik's name the day after the checks were deposited.

In July 2009, they were charged with stealing Malezhik's identity and stealing more than $37,000 in bank withdrawals and credit card charges. Julia and Dmitriy allegedly used Malezhik's money to go on a shopping spree and bought, among other things, expensive matching wristwatches.

Prior to her disappearance, Malezhik told others she was expecting a call from someone she knew only as Dmitriy and that she was afraid. Dmitriy and Julia maintain their innocence and her case; they stated they didn't know her and theorized she had returned to her native Ukraine. Investigators could find no evidence that Malezhik left the United States, however.

Later, Dmitriy admitted he did in fact know Malezhik. He stated she had tutored him in English and he lent her money to buy furniture. He is a native of Russia, where he trained as a surgeon.

In March 2010, Dmitry was additionally charged with Malezhik's murder. He was also charged in the death of Viktor Alekseyev, a jewelry importer whose dismembered body was found in New Jersey in January 2006. When police dug up the Yakovlevs' basement looking for Malezhik's body in 2009, they didn't find it but they did find some items that had belonged to Alekseyev.

The Yakovlevs are also suspects in the disappearance of Michael Klein, a New York Police Department employee who was also an identity theft victim. He went missing in 2003, shortly after selling his house, and has never been found.

Dmitry admitted to using Alekseyev's and Malezhik's credit cards, but he stated they owed him tens of thousands of dollars and had given him permission to use the cards as repayment for the debt.

Julia pleaded guilty to identity theft and credit card fraud in February 2011, just before her trial was scheduled. She maintains she had nothing to do with Malezhik's disappearance and doesn't know her whereabouts. She faces a minimum of two years in prison. In March, Dmitry was convicted of all fifteen charges against him, including Malezhik's and Alekseyev's murders. He was sentenced to thirty years in prison.

Malezhik was employed as a federal court translator at the time of her disappearance. She had worked on sensitive cases involving Medicaid fraud and organized crime, but police don't believe her job was connected to her disappearance.

Malezhik's parents live in Ukraine and she has no relatives in the United States. She is an American citizen and is described as a quiet, private person who was heavily involved in her work.

Marion McCleneghan-Sodo,"February 6, 2010","Brooklyn, NY",40,White,"5'10""",150 lbs,"On February 6, 2010, McCleneghan-Sodo, attended a party at 14th Street and 7th Avenue, about twelve doors down from her own residence in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. She apparently got into an argument with the host and left the party angily at 2:00 a.m.

She left her driver's license, bank card, cellular phone, two packs of cigarettes and $300 in cash in her apartment, but her two laptop computers and her handwritten journals were gone, as were the clothes she had been wearing that night. Her bank accounts and email account have not been used since February 6.

A local bodega owner stated he saw McCleneghan-Sodo at 7:00 p.m. on February 7, over a day after the party. The bodega owner stated McCleneghan-Sodo came into the establishment to tell him goodbye. She was crying and upset, and said she was going to Long Island and he wouldn't be seeing her anymore.

McCleneghan-Sodo's brother lives on Long Island, but he hasn't heard from her and her family can't think of anyone else she knows who lives there.

It's extremely uncharacteristic of McCleneghan-Sodo to leave without warning. Her family stated she had gotten a new job at a medical marketing firm and was satisfied with her life at the time of her disappearance, although she was mourning the recent deaths of a friend, her father and two aunts. She had separated from her husband, but he stated they were friendly with each other and remained in close contact.

McCleneghan-Sodo had been dating Richard Eric Sosa, the man who hosted the party she attended the night of her disappearance. They had been arguing and neighbors heard a loud fight at his home just before she disappeared.

She was supposed to visit her daughter at her aunt's home on east 101 Street and was reportedly last seen entering the residence.

Mondelli never picked up her daughter, however. She has never been heard from again. She was staying in the Daytop Drug Rehabilitation Facility in Swan Lake, New York at the time of her disappearance.

The police refused to take a missing person report for Mondelli until 1998. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance; her family believes she was murdered.

Justina Morales,"November 1, 1995","Brooklyn, NY",8,Latina,,,"Justina was last seen in New York City borough of Brooklyn sometime in November 1995. She lived in an apartment on Halsey Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood at the time, and attended Public School 1. She was frequently absent and one of her relatives reported her truancy to the Bureau of Child Welfare (BCW), and the agency opened a file for Justina. The caseworker couldn't find any evidence of abuse, however.

After Justina had gone three months without attending school even once, the school principal asked Justina's mother, Denise Solero, for an explanation. She claimed they were moving to another neighborhood in Brooklyn and withdrew her P.S. 1 in November 1995; she'd said she would transfer Justina to P.S. 93.

The family did in fact move out of Justina's previous school district, but the child was never re-enrolled in school. Solero told the neighbors she had sent Justina to go live with her father out of town, but this wasn't true either. The BCW closed her file in February 1996, without realizing no one had seen her in months.

In February 1997, a friend of the family went to police and said Justina had been killed. Solero's live-in boyfriend, Luis Santiago, was later charged in her death. Solero pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution and agreed to testify against Santiago. In return, she was sentenced to probation instead of a prison term.

Solero claimed Santiago had been physically and sexually abusing Justina for years and that he also beat her. She was living in a shelter for battered women when Justina was reported missing. She depicted herself as a ""terrorized"" victim of Santiago's abuse and said she was too frightened to protect her daughter from harm.

According to her Solero and Santiago, Justina died on December 31, 1995. Santiago made a videotaped confession to causing Justina's death, saying he had unintentionally killed the girl by beating her with his fists and a metal pole; he stated he was attacking Solero and the child got in the way.

Solero disputed Santiago's version of events, however. She said he had become enraged when Justina refused to take a bath. Over the course of about two hours, Santiago tried to drown her in the bathtub, punched her in the face, threw her against a wall, and then tried to suffocate her with a pillow. Justina finally died after Santiago wrapped duct tape around her nose and mouth while Solero held her hands.

At his December 1997 trial, Santiago was acquitted of murder, but convicted of second-degree manslaughter and evidence tampering. The manslaughter conviction indicated the jury believed his version of events rather than Solero's. He was sentenced to the maximum term of six to nineteen years in prison for manslaughter, as well as 1 and 1/3 years for evidence tampering. A murder conviction would have carried a twenty-five year term.

Solero pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution and was given a five-year probationary term for her role in her daughter's murder. Her probation requirements were stringent; among other rules, she was forbidden to have any contact with her other children without approval by both child welfare officials and the probation office, and she had to notify her probation officer if she became pregnant again.

Many people criticized the deal as being too lenient, but the prosecution said that without Justina's body, Solero's eyewitness testimony was crucial in the case against Santiago. They also stated it wasn't until they'd agreed to the deal that they learned just how complicit Solero had been in Justina's death.

After her conviction, Solero reverted to her former married name. In 1999, she requested supervised visits with one of her daughters, who lived with Solero's sister, but her application was denied. The presiding judge commended her for complying with her strict probation requirements, but denied her visitation request and said, ""At this point, I see no basis to allow her to visit with any child, particularly her own child.""

Santiago and Solero said they wrapped Justina's body in a trash bag and dumped it in a vacant lot in the 400 block of St. Marks Avenue in Brooklyn. Authorities searched the lot thoroughly, but could find no evidence; they believe her remains were hauled away with the garbage when the lot was cleared. Her body has never been found, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/justina-morales,-73.9364564,40.6833545

Pennant has never been seen again and her vehicle has never been located. The friend she was with the night she disappeared said that although she'd recently broken up with her boyfriend, she was acting normally and appeared to be in good spirits.

Pennant was born and raised in Jamaica and graduated from Arden High School. She and her mother moved to New York City in 1992. They lived in Laurelton, Queens at the time of her 1995 disappearance.

Marlene Santana,"October 21, 1985","Brooklyn, NY",3 days,Latina (Dominican),"1'8""",7 lbs,"Marlene was abducted at gunpoint by a female suspect in the New York City borough of Brooklyn at 9:30 p.m. on October 21, 1985.

Marlene's mother, Francisca Santana, met the abductor (sketch is photos 2 and 3) at Brookdale Hospital while giving birth to Marlene, three days prior to the abduction. The woman admired the baby at the nursery window during visiting hours; she said it was the prettiest baby and the quietest one.

Marlene was kept longer than usual due to jaundice, but eventually discharged with a clean bill of health. The suspect kidnapped the baby as her mother was leaving the hospital with her. The child was wrapped in a blue, pink and yellow swaddling blanket at the time of her abduction.

The suspect threatened to shoot Marlene if her mother did not give her up. The two women walked together for six blocks with the suspect pointing a gun at Marlene, then stopped at a deserted junkyard, and the suspect took the baby. Her mother gave the abductor her telephone number and asked her to call. The kidnapper escaped in a waiting car driven by an accomplice. Marlene and the suspect have never been seen again.

Sketches of the abductor are posted with this case summary. She was 5'2 and 130 pounds, and approximately 24 to 30 years old in 1985. She was Caucasian or Hispanic, with dyed red or blonde hair, and may have been wearing a wig. The abduction car was a white 1976 Chevrolet Malibu with red lettering on the door; possibly it was an unlicensed cab.

Marlene's father was in the Dominican Republic at the time of the infant's disappearance and is not considered a suspect in her case. Francisca returned to the Dominican Republic after Marlene's abduction, as she didn't feel safe in the United States. She and Marlene's father had had two children before Marlene, and they subsequently had two more. The entire family still lives in the Dominican Republic and is employed at the family business, a small supermarket.

Although it's possible that Marlene was sold for adoption, authorities don't believe her abductor was a professional criminal. Rather, they think the kidnapper was a mentally unstable woman wanted a child to raise and couldn't have one of her own. Marlene's case remains unsolved.

Audrey Lyn Nerenberg,"July 15, 1977","Brooklyn, NY",18,White,"5'4""-5'5""",115 lbs,"Nerenberg was last seen leaving her family's residence in the 1200 block of Ryder Street in the Canarsie section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn at 2:00 p.m. on July 5, 1977.

The house was located near Kings Highway, Flatlands Avenue and Flatbush Avenue. Nerenberg told her mother she was going two blocks away to purchase cigarettes and would be right back, but she has never been heard from again.

Nerenberg's father received a call from an anonymous individual later during the day. The person claimed he abducted Nerenberg and instructed her father to collect as much money as possible before he called back.

Her father contacted the FBI and the agency sent conspicuously dressed officials to the Nerenbergs' home. The agents left after the caller failed to communicate within three hours. They made no attempt to trace the call. Nerenberg's father thinks the caller was possibly someone from the Flatbush area, possibly someone known to the family, who watched as the officials entered their house.

Nerenberg had been hospitalized for brief periods of time in several New York City medical facilities from 1974 to 1977 as a result of her schizophrenia. She has been a patient at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, Gracie Square Hospital in Manhattan and Hillside Medical Center in Queens.

Nerenberg was an outpatient at Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in Brooklyn at the time she disappeared. She was not carrying any identification or medication with her at the time she was last seen.

It's possible that Nerenberg walked out of her residence while disoriented and did not know her name. However, Nerenberg's parents say she was doing very well on her medication at the time of her disappearance and was able to safely go places on her own. She wasn't attending school and didn't have any friends.

She had no history of running away from home, and although she did occasionally get lost while away from home, but she would always know to call her family for assistance.

Nerenberg accompanied her family to the borough of Staten Island during the evening of July 4, 1977, the day prior to her disappearance. They watched a movie at the former Jerry Lewis Theater on Forest Avenue in Mariners Harbor on the Island.

The theater was close in proximity to a campsite once used by Andre Rand, a convicted child sex offender whose birth name is Frank Rashan.Rand was convicted with kidnapping in connection with the 1987 New York abduction of a twelve-year-old girl named Jennifer Schweiger.

In 2004, Rand was convicted of kidnapping in the 1981 Staten Island abduction of Holly Hughes. Authorities suspect Rand may have been involved in the Staten Island disappearances of Alice Pereira in 1972, Ethel Atwell in 1978, Tiahease Jackson in 1983, and Henry Gafforio in 1984.Rand may be connected to several other missing persons' cases from the Staten Island area as well, but no evidence has been discovered which may link him to the disappearances.

Nerenberg's mental illness sometimes caused her to repeat her actions, and there is speculation that she may have traveled back to the Island on July 5 while disoriented and may have come into contact with Rand. He has not been linked to Nerenberg's case.

Some investigators believe it is possible that Nerenberg may have been admitted to a psychiatric facility as a ""Jane Doe"" (an unidentified female patient) after she vanished in 1977. A search of medical centers failed to produce any leads as to Nerenberg's whereabouts.

Nerenberg accused the operator of a Flatbush-area ice cream parlor of raping her prior to her disappearance, but he denied the allegation, claiming it was consensual sex. No charges were filed against him.

A large hole has been cemented over a section of the business's walls after she vanished. It is not known if the damage is related to her case. The ice cream parlor owner sold the business and moved away three months after Nerenberg vanished.

Nerenberg's father theorizes she was adopted by another family and given another name and Social Security number. There's been no activity on her own Social Security number since 1977.

Nerenberg enjoyed shopping, music and dancing at the time of her disappearance. Her parents moved to Citrus Springs, Florida in 1985. They have never stopped searching for her. The police investigation into her disappearance is still active, but her case remains unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/audrey-lyn-nerenberg,-73.9374508,40.6219858

Lian Fang Feng,"July 19, 2002","Queens, NY",52,Asian,"5'1""",110 lbs,"Lian Feng was last seen at her home on 52nd Avenue in the New York City borough of Queens on July 19, 2002. When her adult daughter, Jena Liang, came home, she found bloodstains on the floor, on the ceiling and on a vase, as well as evidence that someone had tried to clean up.

There were no signs of forced entry. Feng was nowhere to be found; she has never been heard from again.

Liang believes her stepfather, Roger Hui, was involved in Feng's disappearance. Feng and her husband were in the process of what Liang called an ""unfriendly"" divorce but they were still living together. Feng and Hui lived on the second floor of their residence and Liang lived on the first floor.

In 2008, against Liang's wishes, Hui attempted to have his wife declared legally dead so he could become the administrator of her estate and collect her life insurance policy, which was valued at $1 million. The couple co-owned a house; it was sold after Feng's disappearance and her share of the profits were held in escrow.

Liang has accused the New York Police Department of mishandling the investigation into her mother's disappearance. When she asked to see their records for Feng's case, she was told most of them had been destroyed in a flood.

Liang describes her mother as a shy, reclusive woman and stated she could not speak English, although by the time of her disappearance she had lived in the United States for eighteen years. Feng left her wallet and passport behind, and since her disappearance she hasn't accessed the bank account she shares with her daughter.

Samiya Haqiqi,"November 12, 1999","Queens, NY",24,Asian,"5'5""-5'6""",128 lbs,"Haqiqi was a first-year law student at Quinnipiac Law School in Connecticut in 1999. She resided in Hamden, Connecticut at the time.

She was last seen at approximately 2:30 p.m. on November 12, 1999 as she left her final class on campus. She was planning to spend the weekend at her family's home on 159th Street in the Flushing area of the New York City borough of Queens.

Haqiqi never arrived as scheduled and has not been seen again. It is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning; her parents said she called them every day and usually spent weekends at their house.

Authorities believe that Haqiqi planned to tell her then-boyfriend, Fahid ""John"" Popal, that she did not want to marry him. Investigators think that Haqiqi's boyfriend learned about her rekindled relationship with a previous boyfriend prior to November 12 and was angered by the news.

Haqiqi's black 1997 Volkswagen Jetta convertible was discovered abandoned in the Grand Union supermarket parking lot on Northern Boulevard and Marathon Parkway in the Little Neck section of Queens on November 14, 1999, two days after her disappearance.

There was no sign of a struggle at the scene and the car was locked. Authorities found a gold necklace Haqiqi normally wore inside the vehicle. The jewelry had been given to her by her boyfriend.

Haqiqi's mother said that her daughter's car was parked less than one block from Fahid's residence. Haqiqi often parked at the location when meeting friends in the vicinity. Her family members filed a missing person's report with law enforcement the day her vehicle was discovered.

Investigators announced that they considered Fahid the prime suspect in her disappearance in 2000, more than one year after Haqiqi was last seen. Shortly after her disappearance, a witness reported that a man carried a rolled-up rug into the Long Island automobile repair shop where Fahid and his brother, Farhad ""Frank"" Popal, were employed.

Authorities searched the premises and discovered maggots under a hydraulic lift. The insects were tested for evidence of Haqiqi's DNA, in case her blood was near the lift. The results were inconclusive.

A singed clump of hair was discovered in the shop sometime after 1999. DNA testing proved the hair belonged to Haqiqi. Investigators announced that evidence suggested the hair had been violently ripped from her head.

Fahid had since relocated to Fremont, California, where he was arrested in early August 2002 and charged with Haqiqi's murder. Farhad had by then moved to Ontario, Canada and become a naturalized Canadian citizen. He was charged with hindering prosecution in her presumed homicide.

Authorities believe that Fahid killed Haqiqi after learning of her refusal to marry him, then he and Farhad disposed of her remains by burning them with an acetylene torch. Fahid was convicted of her murder in April 2006 and sentenced to 26 years to life in prison.

In May 2006, Farhad pleaded no contest to one count of hindering prosecution. As part of the deal, he served no jail time and was instead required to return to Canada and not re-enter the United States for at least three years.

Haqiqi is a graduate of Newtown High School and St. John's University, where she majored in paralegal studies and made the Dean's List. Her body has never been located.",https://charleyproject.org/case/samiya-haqiqi,-73.737577,40.7684421

Corinna Paige Slusser,"September 20, 2017","Queens, NY",18,White,"5'7""
",140 lbs,"In 2017, Corinna Slusser dropped out of Bloomsburg Area High School one class short of graduation and moved in with living with friends in her hometown of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. She had been a cheerleader in school and dreamed of becoming a makeup artist. She didn't get along with her mother and hoped to move in with her aunt in Massachusetts in January 2017.

In the summer of 2017, she met a man named Yhovanny Peguero, who told her he could give her a place to stay in New York City. She traveled to New York in July, taking only her cellular phone and identification; she didn't even take any extra clothes.

After her arrival she kept in touch with her family and friends, contacting them on a near-daily basis. She indicated everything was going well, but after her later disappearance, her family found out she'd been working as a sex worker, advertising on the internet to get clients.

At 1:00 a.m. August 25, Slusser called 911 from the Harlem Vista Hotel in Manhattan and said Peguero, a man whom she identified as her pimp and called ""daddy"", had stolen $300 from her and that when she confronted him, he grabbed her by the throat, choked her and slammed her against the wall. When police arrived at the scene, she was still very upset, shaking and crying.

Peguero was arrested and charged with harassment, third-degree assault and criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation. A temporary order of protection against him was issued by the court on Slusser's behalf. When her family in Pennsylvania found out about the attack, she downplayed it and told them there was nothing to worry about.

In September, Slusser's grandfather died, and Slusser agreed to go to his funeral in Florida, but a day later she called her mother and said her Social Security card and driver's license had been stolen and so she couldn't fly. She did, however, want to return home to Pennsylvania.

Slusser's mother went to Florida for the funeral on September 19, and Slusser was supposed to arrive home in Pennsylvania the next day, but her mother wasn't able to get in touch with her, and upon her return, she found out Slusser had ever arrived in Pennsylvania. Her mother reported her missing.

Although Slusser's family last heard from her on September 20, according to her family, she was last seen in the early morning hours of September 20, leaving the Haven Motel on Woodhaven Boulevard by 68th Avenue in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens. Slusser had been very active on social media prior to her disappearance, but after September 20 all her posts stopped completely.

Investigators believe Slusser passed through the control of several pimps. In November 2018, Ishi Colin Woney, one of Slusser's alleged pimps, was charged with sex trafficking a woman named only as Victim 1.

The prosecution alleges that between September 2017 and November 2018, Woney used coercion, force and fraud to force Victim 1 to engage in sex acts for money, and brought her to different states, including New York, for this purpose. He also bought online ads promoting prostitution, some of which featured Slusser alongside Victim 1 and offered a ""two girl special.""

Between September 10 and September 20, the day Slusser disappeared, she exchanged over 800 text messages with Woney. They reportedly had an argument on September 20, because Victim 1 was upset about his relationship with Slusser. Woney said he would take Slusser to another hotel and give her to another man. She was never seen again.

A photo of Woney is posted with this case summary. In May 2019, he reached a plea agreement with the prosecution, pleading guilty to four of the five charges against him. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September 2019. He faces five years to life in prison.

Slusser's disappearance remains unsolved.",https://charleyproject.org/case/corinna-paige-slusser,-73.8600544,40.7153804

Gertrude Mary Snedegar,"July 4, 1986","Astor, FL",49,White,"5'10""",160 lbs,"Gertrude was last seen at her home in Astor, Florida sometime in late July 1986. She left her purse behind at home and has never been heard from again. She and her husband, Stephen Cabe Snedegar, had divorced in 1983 but were still living together at the time she went missing.

He told the police that she had left him but he gave five or six different stories about her disappearance to various relatives and investigators. Gertrude was the fourth person associated with Stephen to have disappeared over a five-year period and one of three that was never found.

Stephen had operated a waste oil business in Greenfield, Indiana. In June 1981, he and Gertrude sold the business and moved to Florida. The couple had four children. Their 22-year-old daughter, Lora Lynn Morris, who remained in her parents' Greenfield home after they moved, disappeared in August 1981.

On August 10, Gertrude arrived for a visit with Morris. Investigators believe the visit may have been an attempt to stop Morris from reconciling with her ex-husband, whom Stephen and Gertrude disliked. The morning after her mother's arrival, Morris vanished from her home in Greenfield, leaving her purse and car keys behind, the lights and television on, her bed unslept-in, and the patio door ajar. Gertrude reported her missing that afternoon.

In April 1982, Morris's body was found in a cornfield east of Morristown, Indiana. She had been shot three times in the head with a .25-caliber gun. Her homicide remains unsolved.

Three weeks after Morris disappeared, in early September 1981, Lambert also went missing. He was last seen in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he had gone to meet with Stephen. Stephen had set up the meeting on the pretext of offering him a job managing a new waste oil business, but he actually wanted to question him about his possible involvement in Morris's disappearance.

A possible witness in Morris's disappearance and murder was Charles Darwin ""Chuck"" Smith, a Knightstown, Indiana resident who formerly worked as a driver for Stephen's company. He was working as a gas station attendant in Greenfield when Morris disappeared, and he saw her at the station with a rough-looking man the day before she went missing.

Smith said Morris was a passenger in a vehicle driven by the man, who had long, dirty hair, a tattoo on his arm and a wallet on a chain. Smith stated Morris appeared scared and that the man wouldn't let him to talk to her. Smith initially told only Gertrude about the man, and she said both she and the police already knew the man's identity, but he told the police anyway. He subsequently took a polygraph about his statement and passed.

In early 1982, Gertrude asked the police for Smith's unlisted phone number, saying she'd heard he was unemployed and she had a job for him. She asked the investigators not to tell Stephen.

By July 1986, the Snedegars were having serious problems in their marriage. Gertrude told her other daughter, Brenda Challis, that five nights in a row, she had awakened to find Stephen holding a gun to head, and she was convinced he was going to kill her.

The last time Challis saw her mother, Gertrude was getting dressed to go out country dancing with Stephen. Challis reminded her to take her purse, but said she wasn't going to, as Stephen had enough money for both of them for the night.

Gertrude has never been heard from again. The next morning, Stephen told Brenda that she had left him and moved to Tallahassee, Florida. He spent the morning in his office crying. Later that day, he showed Brenda a suitcase in the trunk of his Mercedes that was full of stacks wrapped, large denomination bills totaling $1 million. He said that Brenda must come get the money if the police arrested him.

Authorities later got a report that Stephen and another man took a plastic-wrapped body out in a fishing boat on the Ocklawaha River, but searches of the river turned up no body. Brenda and her husband traveled to Indiana to report Gertrude missing a year after she was last seen.

By the autumn of 1989, Stephen had terminal cancer. He told a detective from the Lake County Sheriff's Office that he would write down everything he knew about his daughter's murder and the disappearances of his wife, Lambert, and Smith, and that the police could have the journal when he was dead.

A grand jury convened in Florida in 1990 to investigate Gertrude's disappearance. Stephen was considered a key witness in the probe, but he died in January, shortly before he was scheduled to testify. He was 53 years old. The police were never given any of his writings, but witnesses saw papers being burned behind Stephen's house just a few hours after his death.

One possibility as to Morris's death is that Gertrude killed her during an argument over Morris's planned reconciliation with her ex-husband, and that Gertrude's now-deceased father helped her dispose of the body. Gertrude owned a .25-caliber gun, the same caliber as the murder weapon, and carried it in her purse. The police didn't learn about the existence of her gun until 1994.

Investigators theorize that Gertrude engineered Smith's disappearance because what he had seen would have incriminated her, and that Stephen killed Gertrude after he realized it was she who had killed their daughter.

Since Stephen's death the investigation into Morris's murder and the disappearances of Gertrude, Lambert and Smith has stalled. Police searched his former property in Astor in 1994, looking for possible buried bodies, but found nothing. They exhumed Morris's casket to retrieve a letter Gertrude had had buried with her, but haven't disclosed the letter's contents.

They left their home in the vicinity of northwest 59th and Rockwell with some friends, intending to go look for jobs. They didn't say where exactly they were going and what jobs they hoped to find. The two girls never returned and have never been heard from again.

Fawn was classified as a runaway for years after her disappearance, and Rozlin was only listed as a missing person because she'd disappeared with her sister.

They left their home in the vicinity of northwest 59th and Rockwell with some friends, intending to go look for jobs. They didn't say where exactly they were going and what jobs they hoped to find. The two girls never returned and have never been heard from again.

Fawn was classified as a runaway for years after her disappearance, and Rozlin was only listed as a missing person because she'd disappeared with her sister. Both of them had been known to hitchhike, and their loved ones think they could have met with foul play. Neither of the sisters' Social Security numbers have been used since 1985, and authorities believe they're deceased.

Carlee Jade Morse,"August 20, 2010","Westland, Michigan",16,Caucasian / White,"5'0""",90 lbs,"Carlee was last seen in the 7000 block of west Bonnie in Westland, Michigan between midnight and 1:00 a.m. on August 20, 2010. She apparently left her apartment building to talk on her cellular phone, barefoot and wearing only her pajamas, never returned. She didn't take any belongings with her, including her money, purse or any extra clothes, and there's been no activity on her cellular phone since her disappearance.

In December 2010, four months after Carlee's disappearance, Nicholas Jay Cottrell and Justin Lee Yoshikawa confessed to killing her on the night she vanished. Both were charged with first-degree murder, which carries a sentence of life in prison without parole.

Cottrell's mother, Tina Marie Lowe, was charged with being an an accessory after the fact, a misdemeanor; investigators stated she knew about the murder and not only failed to inform police, but also interfered with the investigation. Photographs of Cottrell, Lowe and Yoshikawa are posted with this case summary.

In January 2011, Cottrell struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder and testify against Yoshikawa, in exchange for a sentence of 25 to 50 years in prison.

Both murder defendants knew Carlee and Yoshikawa had dated her in the spring of 2010, but they had an acrimonious breakup during the summer and, according Cottrell, Yoshikawa decided to kill her as a result. He hid inside under some clothes in the backseat of Cottrell's 1998 Ford Escort and Cottrell got Carlee to come outside and invited her into the car to smoke marijuana. He drove her to an isolated spot, then Yoshikawa jumped out and strangled her with a dog leash.

Together, the two men dumped Carlee's body, wrapped in garbage bags, in a trash bin behind a red brick church about an hour or two south of Westland. Cottrell said he couldn't remember exactly where, because he was in shock and under the influence of drugs. He said he thought Yoshikawa planned to kill Carlee's mother as well, and that he had killed other people. He said he had wanted to go to the police with his information before, but didn't because he was afraid for his life.

In November 2011, during Yoshikawa's trial, Cottrell took the stand but then reneged on his plea agreement and refused to testify. He said his guilty plea had been coerced and he wanted to withdraw it.

The judge allowed the transcript of Cottrell's previous testimony to be read to the jury. Before the reading was finished, Yoshikawa pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and admitted Cottrell's statements about the crime were all true. He was sentenced to 35 to 70 years in prison.

Carlee's body has never been located. Some agencies classify her as a runaway, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.","https://charleyproject.org/case/carlee-jade-morse
